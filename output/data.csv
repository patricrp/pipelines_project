5179,How to Start a Travel Blog [2019] Full-Time Travel Blogger,/watch?v=kiNyRY5s7n8,travel blog,"Create a Travel Blog Website for Just $3.95
++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-website

I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name
Sign up for your hosting plan
Install Wordpress
Install your theme
Start blogging
Setup your blog here for just $3.95:

// How to Write a Travel Blog

The really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.

In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.

I’ve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:

Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling something
Paid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white strips
Adsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my website
Freelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businesses
Selling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month

// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger

// find your speciality
- I’ve been blogging full time for 9 years and have taught myself how to code and build sites from scratch. I’ve built websites with 12 million visitors per year, sites with just 50k visitors per month that made $50k in a month and have gone through a ton of website issues and total data losses and this expertise and experience is why I focus on teaching people how to make a website and to me the best place to start is where I started, with bluehost for just $3.95
- Now you could copy my strategy, but building up your own credibility and experience will take awhile, plus you’d have to beat me at it :)
- So instead, I’d suggest you focus on a product or service where you already have expertise or can build your expertise around
- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what’s one thing you’ll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you’d be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you’d be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise
- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you’re interested in and own it

// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeed

If you need any help creating your website and starting your travel vlog, let me know in the comments, I reply to every single one.

5186,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,/watch?v=iXGtx-hroKE,travel blog,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she’s looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

This is the first video of the Bali series. I travelled from Delhi to Bali with Malaysia Airlines. I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment, comfortable reclining seats and relished the vegetarian food. Although it would be better if the flagship carrier of Malaysia can offer more variety of food for vegetarians. After reaching Bali, the first target was to get the Visa on arrival. Bali offers free Visa-on-Arrival for Indian citizens.

I meant to post this a little while ago but I literally just moved to NYC yesterday so I'm a bit behind on all my content right now. Paris was such a dream to enjoy with my family and friends! I lived in Paris on my own when I was 18/19 so it was so amazing to get to show off my favorite spots to some of my favorite people. We didn't hit many of the main touristy spots because most of us had done them before and wanted to just enjoy every day life in the city.
with love,

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let’s start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan’s capital, and home to the world’s largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn’t disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world’s biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you’ll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets.

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I’ve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it’s big, it’s busy and it’s brilliant. As ever, let’s start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you’ll come into one of Tokyo’s two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don’t need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you’ve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you’ve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here’s what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you’re being dropped off. There’s also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport’s dedicated monorail. It’ll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city.

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That’s Haneda! Here’s what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It’ll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you’re flight’s on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there’s a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",bC9m_id_Yds,1237574,Japan,2018

-------------------------------
Tips:
- Take out as much cash you think you will need for the entire trip! On a higher end we would spend about 100 CUC per day on drinks, taxis, tours, food etc. It definitely adds up and goes quickly so be sure to budget!
- We filled out/purchased our Visas and certification at the airport. We flew with Delta so make sure you confirm that you can do that the day of with your airline.
- Download this app! Trust me it will save you in so many ways. The map on here is amazing and its all ""offline"" (Just type in ""Cuba"" in the app store on your phone and its the green one, looks like this) : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triposo.droidguide.cuba

WHERE WE STAYED: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15752806
*Amazing place. Super nice couple that rents it. They gave us a phone that works with their numbers in case and everything is super secure. Great location too!

Places we went to:
- Plaza De La Cathedral: This is perfect for a photo-op plus it has an inlet street with the Cafe I mentioned and a bunch of resturants
- Plaza Vieja: Super pretty, definitely go here for lunch. Great views and a ton of restaurant options with live music.
- Parque Central / Paseo Del Prado : This is definitely a must see! You will find the Capitol building, great hotels with rooftop views and a plethora of classic cars to look at or pick one to ride in.
- Museum of Revolution : This is a great way to cool off and kill some time. It was once home to Presidents and is beyond beautiful as it was designed by Tiffany & Co.
- Hotel National- This is a super fancy hotel with amazing views! We stopped to check it out as a lot of our famous favorites have stayed there. It's definitely a taxi distance away from Old Habana though.

Bars:
Hotel Inglaterra- This is an amazing rooftop bar with an incredible view! I had my share of sangria's here :)
Floridita- One of Hemingway's must stop for a Daiquiri. I really loved these but keep in mind they are 6 CUC a piece compared to 3-4 CUC most other places.
La Bodeguita De Medio- Hemingway Bar #2. This was his go-to spot for Mojitos! Beware this is a tourist trap and you might be drinking your mojito on the street depending on the time of the day.

Cafe:
Cafe De O'Reilly- This was our go-to for breakfast and morning coffee. Try the Cafe Bombon, it was my favorite.

Dinner:
La Guarida- We found this to be our favorite spot. The restaurant requires reservations, but if you forget like us, you can go up to the roof for amazing sunset views and the best food we had the whole trip!

Tips:
- The classic cars you see are Taxi's and cost more than the regular cars. You can however rent one for around 20 CUC for an hour city tour. Definitely worth it. Plus they make for great photos ;)
- If you are staying in Old Habana, the entire area of Habana Vieja and everything I mentioned is super walkable.

Since everyone is a travel blogger now. It's a fight for who can make travel look the best so more people follow them. Travel is amazing and I love that it's a part of my life but there are HUGE gaps in the information and the assumed lifestyles of travel bloggers. (Even some of the ""successful ones""). So per usual, I decided to burst bubbles and share an unpopular opinion about the most omitted facts about traveling/travel blogging.

You mad? It's probably because you know I'm right.

By the 16th century the Arundell family had become well-established and was connected by marriage to nearly all the other landed families in Cornwall.

The status of the family increased through various members gaining good positions at the Royal court. Their legacy is this grand manor on a Cornish scale.

The Arundells inherited Trerice through marriage around 700 years ago. By 1572 John Arundell V had begun building the house we know today. Ten years earlier his income had been boosted by marrying well.

Son of the builder of Trerice, Sir John Arundell VI earned the title John for the King due to his role in the Civil War, especially his defence of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth for Charles I.

After the restoration of Charles II, Richard Arundell became Baron Arundell in recognition of the support he and his father had given Charles I.

We know little about how the Arundell family lived at Trerice. The Arundell line died out in 1768, and Trerice passed to the Aclands.

It was the marriage of John, 2nd Baron Arundell to Margaret Acland in 1675 that eventually led to the great Devonian family based at Killerton inheriting Trerice.

Sir Thomas Dyke Acland never lived at Trerice but often stayed on his political forays into Cornwall. He also used the Great Hall for entertaining.

Initially arriving at Trerice as tenants of its last private owner, the Eltons took on the tenancy from the National Trust in 1953.

At his own expense, John Elton paid for the repair of the remaining parts of Trerice - and went on to rebuild the fallen north wing. His aim was to create a comfortable family home.

25 Things to do in Madrid, Spain | Top Attractions Travel Guide Travel Video Transcript:

Hola y bienvenidos a Madrid. This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city.

Final thoughts on your time in Madrid. Well, I really enjoyed the city. And I really found that it is super walk-able. We were here for 10 days and we hardly had to take the metro at all. We just took the bus once when we were visiting the stadium but the rest of the time we were able to walk wherever we needed to go. And also I think it is a great city for art lovers. There are so many galleries and museums to check out. And a lot of them are free in the evening. So keep that in mind.

And now it is your turn. What did you think of Madrid? You know what? I absolutely loved Madrid. It is a city that just really clicked with me. We have a lot of friends that are living here long term and prior to coming here I had no idea like why would someone want to come to Madrid? Now I totally get it. I love the culture, I love the food, I love the nightlife. Everything is really cheap. I go to the grocery store and I can get a one liter thing of wine for just over a Euro. It is just a really affordable fun city to be in. And it is somewhere I hope I have a chance to come back to again soon.

And that is a wrap of our time in Madrid! We had a splendid time and were truly sad to say goodbye to the city, but that just means we'll have to come back again. If you have any travel tips for Madrid, feel free to share those in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Spain series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Spanish culture, Spanish arts, Spanish foods, Spanish religion, Spanish cuisine and Spanish people.

This video took me almost a year to make! I wanted to release the video last year, however there were many complications involved (lost footage, broken hard drives, footage not good enough etc) and I wanted this video to be perfect! Some of the footage was filmed from up to 4 years ago, if you are wondering why I look so different in some of the footages haha. Really hope you guys enjoy this video, it took me hundreds of hours to film/edit so I hope it was useful!!

Big thanks to these people for helping me make this video happen:
Staff at Tokyo Creative & Odigo
These guys were so supportive and also helped me out tremendously by giving me staff to help me go around to film and take photos.

Sophie https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3OZCZKBy5gmmLf0BXR1w0A
Thank you for accompanying me on a lot of the days I went out to film, and thank you for helping me with footages!

Friends
For those who did’t want to be mentioned but know who you are, thank you so much for going out of your way to help me film! Couldn’t have done it without your help and I’m truly grateful!!

5249,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Killerton House and Gardens,/watch?v=XoxL5TtabrA,travel blog,"The Acland family, who left the estate to the Trust in 1944, did so for the benefit and enjoyment of everybody. Sir Thomas Acland wished to have garden and parkland fit for his family.

Killerton is an 18th-century house in Broadclyst, Exeter, Devon, England, which, with its hillside garden and estate, has been owned by the National Trust since 1944 and is open to the public. The National Trust displays the house as a comfortable home. On display in the house is a collection of 18th- to 20th-century costumes, originally known as the Paulise de Bush collection, shown in period rooms.

The estate covers some 2590 hectares (25.9 km2, 6400 acres).Included in the Estate is a steep wooded hillside with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort on top of it, also known as Dolbury which has also yielded evidence of Roman occupation, thought to be a possible fort or marching camp within the Hillfort.

Killerton House itself and the Bear's Hut summerhouse in the grounds are Grade II* listed buildings.The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

5254,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Thomas Hardy's Cottage, Dorchester",/watch?v=sEmMtAVGlJs,travel blog,"Hardy's Cottage is a beautiful secluded place to visit if you are following the Thomas Hardy Trail through Dorset.The cottage, just outside Higher Bockhapmton, was built by Hardy's great-grandfather in 1800 and little has been altered externally since then.

It is a popular place for tourists to visit and see where Hardy wrote Under the Greenwood Tree and Far from the Madding Crowd.

The cottage is traditionally built from cob and the thatched roof is a wonderful backdrop to the roses, honeysuckle and japonica that climb the walls. Catch the cottage on a sunny Summers day and you won't find a prettier place in Dorset to spend a couple of hours.

The cottage stands at the top of the hill off Cuckoo Lane in Higher Bockhampton and behind it stretches Egdon Heath, which Hardy wrote of in 'The Return of the Native'. Take your walking shoes and enjoy a walk through the woods and beyond into Puddletown Forest.

5262,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Tintagel Castle, King Arthur's seat of power",/watch?v=KUS88AGB0CA,travel blog,"There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility.

Tintagel castle is actually English Heritage, so I got my wires crossed and presumed it was NT because the OLD POST OFFICE is just down the road.  I think I may have gone to visit for free, oh well.

It was not really very accessible but the guys did their best to get my scooter down the hill to the bottom, at £2 each way. You would need to be able to board a land rover, otherwise, the visit will be impossible.

The site of Tintagel Castle has been inhabited at least since the late Roman period, and a community flourished here in the 5th to 7th centuries. In the 12th century Tintagel gained literary fame when Geoffrey of Monmouth named it as the place where King Arthur was conceived. These Arthurian associations may have inspired Richard, Earl of Cornwall, to build a castle at Tintagel in the 1230s, and the enduring legend still ensures Tintagel’s international renown.

The Lucy family owned the land since 1247. Charlecote Park was built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy, and Queen Elizabeth I stayed in the room that is now the drawing room. Although the general outline of the Elizabethan house remains, nowadays it is in fact mostly Victorian. Successive generations of the Lucy family had modified Charlecote Park over the centuries, but in 1823, George Hammond Lucy (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1831) inherited the house and set about recreating the house in its original style.

5277,"Jubril Agoro ""How I Really Make Money ""  Travel Blogging ?",/watch?v=7Hk7PkV-Fb0,travel blog,"People keep asking me this:

""Jubril, how do you make money and still travel the world?""

I haven't actually broke this down in a video before like I'm about to here so watch the video to learn exactly how I make money all while traveling the world at the SAME TIME...

Plus I'm having a free webinar where I outline exactly how I do it:
And you are invited, you can register for free below

http://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/

Also, some things have really changed...
..and I want to update you on what is actually working right now so you can avoid the common mistakes most people make that wastes so much time and money...

The number one way I make money is:

#1 running Facebook Ads for myself as well as a handful of other business owners and marketers by doing exactly this:
I come up with the marketing material, write the ads, then run the ad campaigns for them.

This is by far the most profitable and believe me, most people think Facebook ads are difficult to get working...

But they're not...
You just have to know how to write them.

A perfect example is my client Tiffany...

...she is in the ultra-competitive finance industry.

Where companies usually pay $20+ PER Lead in most cases.

*I generate her leads on Facebook for 40 cents or less*
[We've generated tens of thousands at this small cost]
My secret?

Matching the right audiences together and HOW we create the ads... [which it seems NOBODY does like I do]

But there’s more...

#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays, free travel and 1st class upgrades.

All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that’s your thing. It can be that simple...

#3 Video Production - Shooting videos for our clients, interviewing them and adding some additional 'B' roll footage and background music.

[it's actually a lot easier than most people think with software that already comes loaded on your laptop in most cases]

#4 Affiliate Offers - This is a BILLION dollar industry by itself. It's by simply referring offers from companies that I like and use their products myself. Here’s how it works:

When I send emails about it and people buy the offer, I get paid. Its simple to do and no tech skills required for any of these ways I earn income really.

#5 Hosting & Speaking at Events - We can charge business owners up to 5K to come to a live, in person workshop where we teach them the simple things that we would normally charge to do for them.

Any of these can be learned much easier than you might believe...
Here is what you need to know:

Jon, a youtube marketer who works with business owners was losing thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads...

...he swallowed his pride and finally confessed this to me...
...then I taught him a few basic Facebook Ad strategies, and a year later...

Over million dollars in revenue.

So to get to the point... Do you want me to teach you what I showed Jon how to do as well as my other clients?

If so, I'm holding a free training webinar where I will be revealing the exact strategies I taught Jon.

Plus, if you sign up for the free webinar, the moment you sign up I’m going to immediately redirect you to a training video that shows you...

...what I showed Nathan, my kiwi student... who now generates 5 figures every month and travels the world full time... with a full time income.

You can get all of that right here:
http://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/

[Make sure to get on the list for the free webinar as well]

If you have any desire to start a business online from scratch or learn how grow your business with Facebook ads then you need to be on that webinar.

I'll see you there,
Jubril

5279,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Morwenstow, drift wood cabin, Cornwall",/watch?v=FEr6k0yCswc,travel blog,"There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility.

This driftwood cabin overlooks the cliff top in  North Cornwall, however, I didn't get to see it because of a locked gate.  It was made for a parson named Hawker, and was his quiet retreat with stunning views.

Robert Stephen Hawker (3 December 1803 – 15 August 1875) was an Anglican priest, poet, antiquarian of Cornwall and reputed eccentric. He is best known as the writer of The Song of the Western Men with its chorus line of And shall Trelawny die? / Here's twenty thousand Cornish men / will know the reason why!, which he published anonymously in 1825. His name became known after Charles Dickens acknowledged his authorship of ""The Song of the Western Men"" in the serial magazine Household Words.

He was an eccentric man, known for dressing up as a mermaid and excommunicating his cat for mousing on a sunday!

The garden has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1955 when it was donated by Ida Copeland following the death of her son Geoffrey. A stained glass memorial bearing the Copeland Crest remains to this effect in Feock parish church. The house and garden had formerly been owned and developed by the Daniell family, which had made its fortune in the 18th Century Cornish copper mining industry.

Many of the species that flourish in the mild Cornish air, including the rhododendrons and azaleas which are now such a feature of the garden, were planted by the Copelands including hydrangeas, camellias and flowering cherries, and exotics such as the ginkgo and various species of palm. They also ensured that the blossoms they nurtured had a wider, if unknowing audience. Mr Ronald Copeland was chairman and later managing director of his family's business, the Spode china factory, and flowers grown at Trelissick were used as models for those painted on ware produced at the works.

The Copeland family crest, a horse's head, now decorates the weathervane on the turret of the stable block, making a pair with the Gilbert squirrels on the Victorian Gothic water tower, an echo of the family who lived here in the second half of the 19th century (their ancestor, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, was lost at sea in his tiny ship Squirrel after discovering Newfoundland).

The garden is noted for its rare shrubs. It offers a large park, woodland walks, views over the estuary of the River Fal and Falmouth.

If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9

You don’t have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.

There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9)

Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you’re not traveling? It’s a unique form of writer’s block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it’s been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What’s a travel blogger to do?

Well, I’m here to help you kick that writer’s block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",WMhkRzeGIMI,9085,,2016

Hi, I'm Amber and in May 2017 I started this nomadic journey after selling my house and all my belongings to pursue this crazy dream of living out of my RV full-time and traveling all around North America.

After 1 year of traveling, I sold my 26 foot Winnebago Class C RV for a more nimble Class B Hymer Aktiv van. I couldn't have been more excited to continue my second year in a van that allows me to travel to more places and experience more in life.

Clouds Hill is an isolated cottage near Wareham in the county of Dorset in South West England. It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in the parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.

The small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century. The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription οὐ φροντὶς (""Why Worry""). It is now a Grade II* listed building as ""Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)""; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015.

Our visit Naples travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide to Neapolitan cuisine, top sightseeing tourist attractions and the city by day including visiting cathedrals, pizzerias, the old town, quirky neighborhoods and museums. We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Naples tourism brochure, Naples itinerary or Naples, Italy city tour also known as Napoli Italia.

10 Things to do in Naples, Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript: (NAPOLI)

Tell anyone you’re travelling to Naples and you’ll likely get a few raised eyebrows with some side comments about the mafia, or grid-lock traffic, or garbage on the streets. Somewhere along the way, Naples seems to have earned a bad reputation, but we thought it all sounded a bit too harsh. We wanted to experience the city for ourselves, plus we’d also heard there was good pizza!

We ended up having a grand ol’ time, so join on us as we show you what you can get up to with a couple of days in Naples, plus somewhere along the way, we’ll also reveal where we ate our favourite pizza.

Piazza del Plebiscito seemed like a good place to start our tour. This is a large public square in Central Naples, that earned its name from the 1860 vote that brought Naples into the unified Kingdom of Italy.

The plaza is surrounded by numerous attractions, including the Royal Palace of Naples on one side, and the Basilica of San Francesco di Paola.

We then visited the Royal Palace of Naples. This was one of the four residences in Naples used by the Bourbon Kings during their rule of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

The admission fee was 4 Euros and this gave us access to the Royal Apartments where we got to admire porcelains, tapestries, sculptures and painted ceilings  found within the palace walls.

We visited was Castel Nuovo, an imposing medieval castle that dates back to 1282. This castle was built when Charles I of Naples took the throne and moved his capital from Palermo to Naples.
Admission to the castle was 6 Euros per person.

We stopped by Caffe Gambrinus, a historic coffeehouse in the heart Naples for a bite and drink.

We visited Galleria Umberto I, which is a gallery which vaulted iron and glass ceilings, where you can shop & people watch.

This gallery dates back to the late 1880s and meant to be reminiscent of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan.

While in Naples, we took it upon ourselves to find the best pizza in the city. This involved eating a total of 10 pizzas over two days.
In the end we decided Da Michele was our personal favourite.

Because we always enjoy visiting outdoor markets wherever we go, we stopped by the Fish Market.

Moving on to museums we visited Naples National Archaeological Museum. This museum holds the Farnese Marbles, which is an impressive collection of Roman copies of classical Greek sculptures and ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.

Another place we visited in Naples was the Quartieri Spagnoli, or Spanish Quarter. The streets in this quarter were laid down during the 16th century for the Spanish military barracks outside the city walls. The streets here are narrow and the buildings tall.

And that’s a wrap for our quick 2-day tour of Naples. We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things you can do in the city and all the pizza you can eat in between.

This is part of our Travel in Italy video series showcasing Italian food, Italian culture and Italian cuisine.

Selworthy is a model village, albeit on a hill and inaccessible to me, on a scooter. The village car park features magnificent views of the valley with 12,000 acres of land.

A short episode due to the fact I had trouble walking on the tarmac car park area, let alone going down to the village itself.

Castle Drogo was originally built between 1910 and 1930 for Julius Drewe, a self-made millionaire whose chain of Home and Colonial Stores enabled him to semi-retire in 1899 at the age of 33.

The foundation stone was laid on Drewe's 55th birthday in 1911 and construction took 20 years.

Some aspects of the castle are not accessible, but the garden is ramped despite some steep inclines and bumpy surfaces.

There is also major roofing works being undertaken at the time of the visit, with a view from above for the abler who can climb stairs.

It was at some point maybe also my fault as said in the video - but bad things can happen everywhere in the world.

I was amazed by the great help I received afterwards from all the people around me - especially the argentine people have been so nice to me which actually makes me even love Argentina more!
I thank all of you guys for your kind words and support afterwards - with your help I'm now almost recovered and continue what I love to do: Traveling.

In this episode I visit BASILDON PARK and HOUSE, a very inaccessible building apart from a few rooms on the ground floor. There are a lot of ramps with no where to go, and on a typical English weather day, this would be an average sort of visit reliant upon physical ability to climb a spiralling staircase to the main  floors of the house.

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it’s one of the best places I have ever ever visited.

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver’s clean air is thanks to it’s really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn’t just a place, it’s a way of life. But it’s a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we’re going to help you make the most of it! We’re going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let’s get from the airport.

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward – a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45.

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain – it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here’s what you need to know:

Now it’s not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There’s ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn’t too bad in our experience.",w7EyUJSjFko,1144671,Canada,2017

Lanhydrock is unquestionably one of the most impressive (and popular) historic houses in Cornwall. Built of local grey slate and granite around an inner courtyard, the house dates to 1640, though most of the current building was the result of rebuilding after a fire in 1881.

I often have people asking me questions about travel blogging or blogging in general, but it's difficult to give good advice in just a paragraph or even a few sentences. So I thought I'd share some more substantial thoughts on how to have the right mindset, expectations, and process to be successful in travel blogging. 5 years ago I benefited a lot from what others taught about blogging so, in turn, hopefully you will find my random thoughts useful in some way!

VERY SORRY for the focus moving in and out. My camera was having a bad day.

In this episode I visit GREYS COURT, a Tudor house and garden near Henley on Thames, Oxfordshire.

It was a visit of mixed success, and despite a map I failed to find the garden and had to accept a wheel-chair for the house due to a ban on scooters following a crash into a valuable table by a poor driver.

It was a lovely day, despite the scooter breaking down while going up a grassy slope.

Snowshill Manor is in the cotswolds, and from the start mobility was challenged. Because this was late in the day, there were no disabled bays. Then I got stuck in the gravel.  I discovered there was no ramps and access to the house limited.

important stuff relative to accessibility.

In this episode, I visit Dunster Castle, near Minehead in North Somerset.  A setttlement has been around here for 12,000 years and at one time the castle, high on a hill, had the sea lapping around nearby - now a good couple of miles distant.

The property is ""accessible"" to wheelchair users who are happy to use the stair climber or to walk up 4 steps at the rear with the limitation of only seeing the ground floor but this is the expected scenario in any case with old properties such as these.

David Moore, Manager, was very accommodating and extremely helpful and indeed all the staff made me feel very welcome.

In this episode I visit NUFFIELD PLACE, the home of Lord and Lady Nuffield, otherwise known as William Morris of the car name fame. He purchased the home and garden and made it his, by extending and modifying it to suit his needs.

Career wise he started as an apprentice bicycle repairer and moved into making them when his request for a pay rise was rejected.  Later, he went into making cars and built the name of Morris around the Cowley area of Oxfordshire.

Morris purchased Wolsley in the expansion process and during his lifetime put the profits to good use, donating about £8bn equivalent nowadays to charitable causes in the medical and education arena, such as Nuffield Orthopedic Hospital where I had my second back operation.

While scooters were a problem, they made an effort and provided me with a pusher/wheelchair.  I think I got a bit of personal treatment with a guided tour and commentary.

The only downfall was the gate to the disabled parking area which would be difficult for solo drivers.

Broadclyst is a village and civil parish in the East Devon local government district. It lies approximately 5 miles northeast of the city of Exeter, Devon, England, on the B3181. ... Until 1966 the village was served by its own railway station named ""Broad Clyst"".

Its church is 15th century, with an ancient cross. It has many battlements, pinnacles and gargoyles. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the year 1001, the manor at Broad Clyst was burned down by Danish invaders.

Killerton House, a National Trust property, is close to the village, as well as Broadclyst Cricket Club, which play within the gardens of Killerton House. The village pubs are the Red Lion Inn and the New Inn on Whimple Road. The Clyst Vale Community College secondary school is located in Dog Village.

Churchill Farm is the origin of the name of the Churchill family.

They reveal how traveling with kids has shaped them as a family unit, and how they have opened up their minds and become adaptable, kind-hearted, social and accepting beings.

So take your kids on an adventure - near or far - despite the struggles, tantrums and hardships, I can guarantee - it'll all be worth it in the end.

I love travel blogging I have had a travel blog for 3 years now. It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once.

SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us!

Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog! Keep watching till the end for that :)

5356,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Max Gate, home of Thomas Hardy",/watch?v=v_KDI-PGFQU,travel blog,"Max Gate, an austere but sophisticated town house a short walk from the town centre of Dorchester, was the home of Dorset's most famous author and poet Thomas Hardy. Hardy, who designed the house in 1885, wanted to show that he was part of the wealthy middle classes of the area, to reflect his position as a successful writer, and to enable him to enter polite society. The house was named after a nearby tollgate keeper called Mack.

Many of Hardy's possessions were dispersed before the Trust acquired the house, but we've furnished the rooms for you to enjoy the spaces he created to write and live in. He wrote some of his most famous novels here, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure, as well as much of his poetry.

You will find the garden much as it was originally planned, with high walls and large trees encircling the property to preserve Hardy's privacy. The sundial, designed by Hardy, was erected in his memory.

The Vyne is a Tudor manor house associated with King Henry 8th and other prominent figures in history

Located near Basingstoke, it is a large estate and house, which is under repair until the end of 2017.

In my tour around the house, I was confronted in public, being told to stop filming (but stills are ok) after a staff member chatted to me regarding the GoPro and equipment, but did not just tell me - instead of going off and reporting me.  Even reception made no mention of it.

The saving grace was the roof top view.

Our visit Lima travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums and the city by day. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Lima tourism brochure or Lima, Peru city tour.

30 Things to do in Lima, Peru | Top Attractions Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Many travelers to Peru tend to skip over Lima as they rush off to more scenic destinations, but we’re of the opinion that the capital has a lot to offer. As one of the largest cities in South America, Lima can be a little chaotic and crowded, but it is also full of surprises, especially in terms of culinary experiences and historic attractions. In this travel video guide, we’re going to take you on a tour of the city and show you 30 things to do in Lima, Peru. Now let’s get started!

And that’s a wrap for the Peruvian capital. We had a wonderful time visiting Lima and we hope that you’ll consider adding this destination to your travel bucket list if you come to Peru. As always, if you have any other suggestions of delicious foods to try, or cool things to do in Lima that we may not have mentioned, feel free to share those with travellers in the comments below. For more food and travel videos from around the world, be sure to hit subscribe!

This is part of our Travel in Lima, Peru video series showcasing Peruvian food, Peruvian culture and Peruvian cuisine.

Begin your journey on the island of Cijin, and visit Tianhou Temple, where Matzu, the protector of fishermen and sailors, is honored. Next, head further inland and hike the trails at Monkey Mountain; have a spot of tea with a view of the city as monkeys swing overhead from the treetops. Other popular attractions include Love River, which offers scenic pathways that run through the city, and Lotus Lake, where the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas are said to give visitors good luck. At the lake, honor the Goddess of Mercy and God of War, and marvel at the massive statue of the Mysterious Warrior, Xuan Wu. After visiting Lotus Lake, don’t miss the nearby Tianfu Palace and Taiwan’s largest Confucian Temple.

Round the day off with a jaunt to the Liuhe Night Market. As one of the largest markets in Asia, these open-air stalls serve up the freshest seafood around.

Whether you’re looking to pay your respects to the gods or find a quiet spot on the harbor with a view, check out our Kaohsiung travel guide for more travel tips and inspiration.

Our visit Lisbon travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts, entertainment, museums, nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Lisbon city guide.

20 things to do in Lisbon, Portugal | Top Attractions Travel Guide:

Our first stop of the day was Sao Jorge Castle, which is an old Moorish fortification that sits on a hill overlooking Lisbon and the Tagus River. You can get some nice panoramic views of the city from here, and they also have peacocks roaming the grounds.

Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of the many look out points in Lisbon that offers postcard-perfect views of the city. This particular terrace overlooks the Alfama district and it is always popular with tourists.

Carmo is a mediaeval convent that was ruined during the 1755 earthquake, and today it is used as an archaeological museum.  It's a strange feeling walking down the ruined nave of the church and seeing blue skies above your head, but that's exactly what makes it worth a visit.

Another place to visit is Belem Tower. The tower was built on the banks of the Tagus River, and it was meant to act as both a defense system and a ceremonial gateway into Lisbon.

The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon. It's one of the best examples of Late Gothic Manueline architecture, so have a close look at the intricate detailing when you visit.

A fun way to get around Lisbon's hilly streets is by riding the trams. There are different lines across the city, but #28 is the most popular one with visitors.

The Santa Justa lift is an elevator that connects the lower streets of Baixa with Carmo Square, and it is the only remaining vertical elevator in Lisbon. Though it is meant to serve a functional role, it is also quite popular with visitors who find the elevator a novel idea.

And that's a wrap for our week in the Portuguese capital! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you some ideas of things to do in Lisbon. As always, if you have any other suggestion for travellers of places to visit and things to do around town, feel free to share them in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels!

This is part of our Travel in Portugal series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Portuguese culture, Portuguese arts, Portuguese foods, Portuguese religion, Portuguese cuisine and Portuguese people.

20 Things to do in Kraków, Poland Travel Guide video transcript:

We kicked off this trip to Poland with a visit to Krakow, a city people have been telling us to visit for years and now we know why. Krakow in the summertime was wonderful! We spent our time enjoying castle views from the river side, exploring neighbourhoods covered in street art, eating some of the best pierogie of our lives, and also discovering what we think may be the best ice cream. The following is our travel guide to some of the best things to do in Krakow!

Wawel Castle is Krakow's crowning jewel, and for centuries it was the residence of the kings of Poland. You can see a mix of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque architecture all in one place.

While in the city, we also had to walk the Royal Route, which was once the historic coronation path of Polish kings.

After visiting the basilica, we spent a bit of time walking the Main Square, which just so happens to be Europe's largest medieval town square.

And that’s it for our visit to Krakow! We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other places to add to this list or any tips for fellow travellers visiting Krakow feel free to share those.

This is part of our Travel in Poland video series showcasing Polish food, Polish culture, Polish cuisine while visiting Kraków Polska.

5407,FROM BARCELONA TO BOGOTA - TRAVEL BLOG #149,/watch?v=CV_HZIilVoA,travel blog,"(σﾟ∀ﾟ)σ Travel video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Z8DN4yCp0

Our travel to Costa Rica starts now, but the first stop is different. First, we need to go from Barcelona to Bogotá, that we do with the flying company Avianca.

The travel is long, around 11-12 hours, but that's how the cookie crumbles if you want to visit other parts of the world I guess.

In Bogotá, we spend only one night as we need to take our connection flight to Costa Rica.

5408,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,/watch?v=35reI2AqbrM,travel blog,"Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like.

'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day.

In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different.

This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing.

In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: https://www.alajode.com/blogging-vlogging-camera-gear/

As always, thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!

“Era informasi”, artinya informasi makin mudah didapatkan, makin penting, juga makin berharga nilainya! Travel blogger adalah sumber informasi dan pusat informasi dalam industri pariwisata global senilai USD 1,7 T. Peran mereka sangat besar dan dibutuhkan oleh pelaku industri, ataupun konsumen sendiri. Ini membuat travel blogger pun jadi sebuah profesi yang valid!

Video ini membahas sebagian besar sumber dan peluang income Travel Blogger, dan bagaimana para travel blogger bisa bekerja sambil jalan- jalan keliling dunia.

Tambahan: Travel Blogger pun seringkali membuka jasa (dan meraih income melalui) “Tour dan Travel”, untuk berjalan- jalan dalam kelompok kecil bersama dirinya sebagai ""companion"".

 “Dari Mana Duitnya?” adalah segmen singkat yang setiap episodenya bakal membahas berbagai profesi, dan sumber- sumber income dari profesi- profesi itu, untuk membuka wawasan kita semua tentang besarnya potensi income dari berbagai profesi, dan menginspirasi kita untuk menemukan atau mengembangkan sumber income kita sendiri.

Our visit Nuremberg travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (Nuremberg Bratwurst, beer and pretzels), top sightseeing tourist attractions and the city by day including visiting castles, churches and museums. We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Nuremberg tourism brochure, Nuremberg itinerary or Nuremberg, Germany city tour.

10 Things to do in Nuremberg, Germany travel guide video transcript:

We started our day by taking the U-bahn to the centre of town and getting off at Lorenzkirche. This put us on the south bank of the Pegnitz River, where we took the opportunity to browse some markets before visiting St Lorenz Church.

This is a beautiful gothic church complete with pointed vaults, stained glass windows, and sculptures.

From there we walked across one of the city’s many bridges and continued on to the Beautiful Fountain (yes, that’s the name), searching for a bit of good luck.

One of Nuremberg’s most famed attractions is the Imperial Castle located in the northwest end of the Old Town. The castle is a testament to the power of the Holy Roman Empire during the middle ages.

And we couldn’t come all the way to Nuremberg and not try the famed Nuremberger sausage! We went to Bratwursthäusle, right in the heart of the Old Town by St Sebaldus Church.

Later that afternoon we went into Nuremberg’s deep underground on a tour of the historic beer cellars. Nuremberg has been a beer brewing city for centuries.

While in town, we also took a walk down Weißgerbergasse, which may just be one of the prettiest streets in Nuremberg. This curved cobbled street is lined with half-timbered houses.

Albrecht Dürer’s one time home is now a museum dedicated to his life and work. He was a German Renaissance artist across many mediums, but he is best known for revolutionizing printmaking and elevating it as an art form. At certain times of day, they offer a guided tour with an actress who plays the role of Agnes Dürer, the artist’s wife.

The bridge we were looking for is the Heilig-Geist-Spital, or the Holy Spirit Hospital. It’s not a bridge in the usual sense of the word, rather a medieval building that sits across part of the Pegnitz River.

On a more serious note, we couldn’t leave Nuremberg without also visiting the Dokuzentrum, also known as the The Documentation Center Nazi Party Rallying Grounds.

And that’s a wrap for a our guide to Nuremberg, Germany. If you have any other suggestions of cool things to do in Nuremberg, feel free to share those with fellow travellers in the comments below.

Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.

20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.

So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.

Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.

For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.

So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.

The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.

Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city’s canal system.

Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco.

So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.

And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.

This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture, Italian arts, Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

5440,HOW I TRAVEL FOR FREE AS A TRAVEL BLOGGER | DUSSELDORF ASSIGNMENT,/watch?v=E3ykgXDpOZs,travel blog,"In my last video, I talked about how I afford to travel full-time. In that video I talked about how I pay for my travel but I also sometimes travel for free when I'm on a press trip - and today I'm going to show you what that means.

I've been travel blogging for nearly 5 years, and during that time I've been on a fair few press trips. If you've been watching my travel videos for a while, you've probably seen content from a couple of those press trips! But I've never really shown you what it's like from behind the scenes.

So today we're going to talk about press trips. I want to show you how I travel for free on travel blogger press trips... and why it's not really free at all! Yes, my flights, accommodation, expenses and everything else are paid for when I'm on a press trip. But I still have to pay for it - in time and work.

This press trip was a food tour of Dusseldorf, Germany. Each day had a different theme and the theme for the first day of the press trip was ""favourite drinks"". In my next video, I'm going to take you on a full food tour of Dusseldorf, but in this one I just wanted to talk about how press trips work and how I travel the world for free (kind of).",E3ykgXDpOZs,2245,Germany,2018

A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings.

Your London tour must include St. Paul’s Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. You’ll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the city’s famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where you’ll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. You’ll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week.

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

Visit our London travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

5448,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,/watch?v=ieWNzZPfZzk,travel blog,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro.d178301.Destination-Travel-Guides

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying.

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out.

The “Cidade Maravilhosa,” or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

Brazilian Fire - This drink is made with cachaça, the most popular distilled alcohol beverage in Brazil. Soak a habanero pepper in a bottle of cachaça for two weeks. Then pour 2 oz of the cachaça into 1 oz of lemon juice, 1 oz of lime juice and 1 oz of Grand Marnier. Serve over ice and enjoy!

Costa Brava Sangria - Take a traditional sangria recipe and substitute the red wine for Cava, the Spanish sparkling wine.

Odin's Revenge - Mix 2 oz of Brennivin into a glass of porter, add a dash of bitters and drizzle with maple syrup.

Sri Lankan River Boat - The base of this drink is Ceylon, liquor made from the distilled sap of coconut blossom. Stir 2 oz of Ceylon into a ginger beer, add a little bit of gin and a squeeze of lime.

Pele's Passion - Combine 3 oz of Koloa Spiced Rum with 2 oz of guava juice, 1 tablespoon of passion fruit butter and half of a mango. Blend it all together and serve over ice for a liquid paradise.

It includes colonial-era cities with wonderful architecture and history, ancient pre-hispanic ruins, fiestas, Mexican art and artists, indigenous dances, hiking, and much more. We use our photographs to illustrate the stories behind all of this.

Jim and Carole have each lived in various parts of the US, but mostly in California and Oregon. They moved to Ajijic, Mexico in 2007 and have lived full-time there for the past decade. Their blog is intended to be a guide others can use to experience some of the wonders of Mexico and Central America.

5460,How to Ride the London Tube | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog,/watch?v=4tLESFBpxkk,travel blog,"Kate Thomas from the Expedia Viewfinder travel blog shares the basics for getting around London on The Tube.

The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly.

3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:

1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more.

2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs £5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the £5 and any remaining balance.

3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

5463,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,/watch?v=vzSHcyXfNPw,travel blog,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.

Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland’s natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgrímskirkja.

Many of the country’s most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjavík. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland’s greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.

Iceland’s main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world’s most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss. Continue eastward towards Vík, Iceland’s southern-most village, where you’ll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of Jökulsárlón Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe’s largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.

Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe’s mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.

Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it’s one you’ll keep telling for the rest of your days.

5464,"How to Become a Travel Blogger: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly",/watch?v=URi_SsPtbhs,travel blog,"How to Become a Travel Blogger - http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBlog

Becoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.

A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:

1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.

Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.

There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, http://sassyzengirl.com/GuestBlogging

Guest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:

2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.

Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.
http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBloggingCourse

This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEO
Ho to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:

SEO 1 - https://youtu.be/U08NeWHApBU
SEO 2 - kw - https://youtu.be/MmdlJi69S7I
SEO 3 - OnPage - https://youtu.be/3hTvkkMXuyc
SEO 4 - OffPage - https://youtu.be/zpTumr0uy2Q

3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etc
http://sassyzengirl.com/Budget-Travel-Book

Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.

Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.

As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out http://theplanetd.com - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.

But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.

Just choose to think better feeling thoughts. Listen to your emotions and chose to feel good. You can decide to be in a place of attraction and abundance.
What do you want to do in your life? What makes you tick? What makes you feel awe? Don’t be misled into thinking that you’re supposed to do anything.

With its pristine beaches and palm tree-lined streets, Miami is one of the top tourist destinations in the country.

Start your Miami tour out right with a sample of delicious Cuban cuisine, followed by some Latin dancing. You’ll find plenty of places all over the city to indulge in both, as well as art galleries, theaters, and numerous murals that contribute to Miami’s artistic spirit. Visit South Beach, or SoBe if you’re a local, and admire its Art Deco district, which is full of remarkable pre-World War II architecture.

Continue your Miami sightseeing at iconic Miami Beach, where the streets are lined with palm trees, exotic hotels, and eye-popping cars. Move on to the white sands of the beach itself and lay out in the sun, or try some more physical activities, like paddleboarding, biking, or in-line skating along the boardwalks.

No trip to Miami is complete without a visit to the Everglades and the nearby wildlife habitats, like the Jungle Zoo, where you can get up close and personal with a variety of living creatures. Don’t forget to say hello to the pink flamingos!

5477,Japan Travel Blog: Hakone Day Trip (From Tokyo to Hakone),/watch?v=oCjkRzSFckw,travel blog,"Visiting Tokyo? You don't have to restrict your holiday to just within the city, you can also take a day trip to Hakone from Tokyo via Train.

Make your way to Odakyu and purchase your tickets from the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center. The tickets would include whatever you need for the entire day.

To get to Hakone, you would have to take the train and change to an uphill tram, before changing to the Hakone Tozan Cablecar which 1st stop would be at Mt Hakone.

You would be able to take pictures with this active volcano, and also try their famous black eggs.

Once done, hop back onto the cable car which would take you past a few stops including one that gives you a great view of Mt Fuiji on a good day.

Continue on the cablecar till the end to reach the cruise center, where you would board thie gigantic cruise ship which would take you across lake ashi.

Take a short stroll and embrace the beauty of the beautiful sakura trees found along the river.

A short 15mins walk and you would find yourself at Hakone shrine. Drink from their famous 9 headed dragon basin, visit the fertility tree and also take pictures at the huge tori gate by the lake.

30 Things to do in Cape Town, South Africa Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Today we’re taking you around one of our favourite cities: Cape Town, South Africa.

We first visited Cape Town in 2015 as the final stop on a monthlong trip across South Africa. However, by the time we arrived, we only had a couple of days to spare and the weather was less than ideal, so we didn’t get to see very much.

We knew we had to return to do the city justice and also film a proper Cape Town travel guide for you guys. This time around, we gave ourselves a full week to spare.

Our days were packed with sightseeing, and with visits to restaurants, chocolate shops, wineries and gin distilleries, so without further delay, let us show you 30 things do in Cape Town, South Africa.

And that’s a wrap for our week in Cape Town, South Africa. We hope you enjoyed following along and that this guide gave you a few ideas of things to see, do and eat in Cape Town. As always, if you have any other suggestions for fellow travellers, feel free to share those in the comments below. In the meantime, wishing you happy travels and see you next time!

This is part of our Travel in South Africa video series showcasing South African food, South African culture and South African cuisine.

-----------------------------------------------
New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown! When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away.

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free:
http://www.tourradar.com/d/new-zealand

New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries.

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: http://www.newzealand.com/

---About New Zealand---

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep.

The country is divided into two portions: the North and South Islands separated by the Cook Strait. The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

5492,Exploring Urk - Travel Vlog (Video Blog) Travel Netherlands 🇳🇱,/watch?v=2DgICLDyHpU,travel blog,"A guide to Urk, this is our second vlog (video blog) about Urk, a small fishing town in the ""bible belt"" of The Netherlands that still maintains its past traditions.

More at http://secretsofaworldtraveller.com/2015/06/07/city-full-of-old-traditions/

Urk is a typical city were traditions from past still stand strong today. Especially on days like Urkerdag or Vlaggetjesdag people dress up in traditional clothing and perform chores and other things like they did back in the day. Urk is a very religious city and almost all inhabitants are or were fishermen. One of the traditions that still is going strong on a daily basis is men wearing golden earrings with ships on the waves. Some of them also have an earring with their name in the other ear. This tradition stems from back in the day when men from Urk drowned while at sea they would get a proper burial paid for by the city if they had gold in their ears. On days like Urkerdag or Vlaagetjesdag you can eat smoked salmon, smoked eel, fried kibbeling, salted raw herring and so on. But you can also buy things for your boat, old jewelry, cutlery, plates, and other knick-knacks. It is amazing to get a glance of this otherwise so closed community. While we were there we found out what Urk means and where it comes from.

Urk used to be an island, until the former Zuiderzee became the lake IJsselmeer. It’s best known as a fishing village. At the harbor there is always loads of activity going on. You enjoy the action from a distance on one of the many terraces. The same harbor also offers all kinds of water sports opportunities.
Highlights of Urk

Urk's history goes back over one thousand years. Visit the old village and you can still feel the history it holds. Enjoy the beautiful surroundings by walking through the old village or from the water by boat. It’s highly recommended to eat some fresh fish in the harbor. You can also enjoy excellent fish dishes at one of the local restaurants. The nearby eel farm and a trip over the lake with the tourist line to Enkhuizen are also highly recommended.
Visit Urk

Urk is a small village with a great history, ideal for lovely walks. Charming shops, museums, beach, harbor and pool are within walking distance. Do note that the tourist line between Enkhuizen and Urk only sails in summertime. Most inhabitants of Urk consider Sunday a day of rest, so it’s best to visit Urk on weekdays or on a Saturday.

Many people don't realize this but Chicago is a world class city with festivals, arts, entertainment, dining and architecture that can rival any city in North America or even Europe.  The only other city that I think can compare with Chicago - in terms of attractions - in America is New York. Whether you're scarfing down Chicago style deep dish pizza or taking in a Blues festival you'll find no shortage of things to do in the city. If you're a sport fan there are no shortage of professional teams to follow at any time of the year including the Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Bears and the Chicago Bulls. When you're thinking of destination to travel to in the United States, Chicago should be near the top of your list.  I guarantee that you'll have a lot of fun:

You can't come to Chicago and not eat deep-dish pizza! During our week here we ate at many pizzerias in town including Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Gino's East Side, and Pizzeria Uno. Formerly known as the Sears Tower, Willis Tower is now the 2nd tallest building in the United States. Many of the buildings at the University of Chicago were designed in the Gothic style.
which is in Chicago's South Side. For a chance to come face to face with dinosaurs, head over to the Field Museum. Right next door is the Shedd Aquarium which is a popular attraction for families. Visit the John Hancock Center by night as the city really dazzles from the 94th floor. The Navy Pier is a fun place to visit on a weekend including a Ferris Wheel. Chicago's Museum of Science and Technology is the largest science museum. It's hard to miss the flashing lights of the historic Chicago Theatre! Music has creative commons attribution license:

5494,23 Things To Do In Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) Vietnam,/watch?v=N0crXGYLYlg,travel blog,"►Read 23 Things to do in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnam: http://migrationology.com/2015/06/things-to-do-in-saigon-ho-chi-minh-city/
►FREE eBook: http://migrationology.com/saigon-ebook/

When I was in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), along with eating as much Vietnamese food as I could, one of my goals was to film a travel video about some of the best things to do in Saigon. After putting together a complete list, it turned out to be 23, and I hope this list of attractions will help and inspire you to visit Vietnam’s largest and most exciting city.

1. Binh Tay Market - Binh Tay Market is one of the largest wholesale distribution markets, and a perfect place to go if you’re looking to go shopping in Ho Chi Minh City.
2. Thien Hau Temple (Pagoda) - Located in Chinatown, in District 5, the temple is dedicated to Thien Hau and I really loved the sculptures and the elaborate design of the temple.
3. Museum of Ho Chi Minh City - This museum offers a glimpse into the history and development of the city and Vietnam.
4. Bitexco Financial Tower - This is the tallest building in Saigon, and you can either go to the Skydeck or a cafe at the top for a view of the city.
5. Independence Palace (Reunification Palace) - Probably one of the most well known tourism things to do in Saigon is to visit the Independence Palace, the the former home of the president of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.
6. Saigon Cathedral of Notre Dame - With the French influence in Vietnam, the Notre Dame cathedral is a beautiful Catholic church. Attend a service or just visit.
7. Central Post Office - Designed by Gustave Eiffel, the Central Post Office in Ho Chi Minh City is an attraction mainly for its design and architecture. It’s a beautiful building.
8. War Remnants Museum - Although this is not one of the happiest attractions in Saigon, it’s a place to remember and honor the horrible events that are a result of a war.
9. Opera House - Right in Dong Khoi area, and there are still opera shows available.
10. Dong Khoi Street - This is the height of high end shopping in Saigon.
11. Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens - The zoo itself is not too great, but the beauty of the Saigon zoo is the botanical gardens, and the lush gardens, and taking a break from the city.
12. FITO Museum (Museum of Traditional Vietnamese Medicine) - I was quite impressed by the Vietnamese medicine private museum - very interactive and educational.
13. San Art Laboratory – If you love modern art, the San Art Laboratory is a great place to see and visit in Saigon.
14. Turtle Lake at Night - If you’re looking for some things to do at night in Saigon, head to Turtle Lake to chill out, relax, hang out with friends, and eat snacks.
15. Ben Thanh Market - One of the most famous things to do in Saigon District 1 is visit the Ben Thanh Market, one of the major central landmarks of the city.
16. Phu My Hung and Starlight Bridge - Located outside of central Ho Chi Minh City, Phu My Hung is a modern development, and a great place to walk around.
17. Water Puppet Show - Though originally from the north of Vietnam, water puppet shows are popular also in Saigon. I went to the Golden Dragon Water Puppet theater.
18. Museum of Vietnamese History - Probably one of the most extensive and important museum showing the history of Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City.
19. Rooftop Bar - Seeing Saigon from above offers a great perspective.
20. Fine Arts Museum - This was my favorite of all the museums in Saigon. The museum is housed in a well preserved building, and the art is amazing - located right in District 1 across the roundabout from Ben Thanh Market.
21. Jade Emperor Pagoda - Dedicated to the Jade Emperor, the pagoda has a real ancient feel to it, and it’s worth seeing when you visit.
22. Local Wet Market - One of my favorite things to do is visit a local fresh wet market, which you’ll find all over the city. The ingredients, food, and culture, all stand out at fresh markets.
23. Vietnamese Street Food - By my ultimate favorite activity in Saigon is eating street food, and there are an abundance of delicious Vietnamese street foods to sample.

Thank you for watching this video about the top 23 things to do in Saigon, Vietnam. I hope it has given you some great ideas to help you plan your visit.

Is this true?

What would Chinese people do? And would they start a blog in an apparently saturated niche like the travel one?

Well I'm currently living in China so I have a unique take on the situation...

From 03:50 onwards in this video I show some traffic statistics from a travel blog I started back in 2012. Has it been successful? Watch to find out!

In one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didn’t realize until after we finished eating, but we didn’t eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!

We started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I’m pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It’s stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It’s sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It’s served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.

The next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!

Afterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.

After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!

After this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!

After this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.

The addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:

1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha Hut
Gali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I. Colony, NRI Colony, Gumtala, Amritsar, Punjab 143001, India
2) Amazing Poori and Chole and desserts at Kanha Sweets
Shop 1, Opposite Bijli Pehalwan Mandir, Lawrence Road, White Avenue, Amritsar
3) Fairly OK veg curry DEEP in the back lanes of Amritsar (honestly can’t remember this address, go for the Kesar De Dhaba instead).
4) Delicious Street Lassi at Ahuja Lassi
Near Hindu College, Amritsar, India
5) BEST Vegetarian Curry in the WORLD @ Kesar De Dhaba, Amritsar
6) Amazing Mango sour and spicy dessert at Aam Papad:
Ram lubhaya and sons
7) Potato Samosa at Raam samosey wala

5512,🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Pol Sambol - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Coconut Sambol,/watch?v=bZ7sBsE5kwA,travel blog,"One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgreat/posts - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgreatcurry/ - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",bZ7sBsE5kwA,5612,India,2017

When NY-based fashion illustrator Meagan Morrison first began her career, she was still unfamiliar with the field that lay ahead.
In Elite Daily's exclusive video behind the scenes with her at NYFW, she reveals,

It was like a whole world had opened up to me. There was no better suited profession for me.

Fashion illustrators translate the tangible styles and effects you see on the runway and build a whole imaginative world of fashion on the page.

They gain insider access to fashion shows and make art from art. It's all very beautiful and avant-garde.

Meagan was asked to be one of Tumblr's New York Fashion Week bloggers during last week's festivities.

Take a peek inside Meagan Morrison's colorful world of fashion illustration and check out how she infuses her own style in style.

This is the best advice from bloggers who are currently making their living from travel blogging and have since become millionaires.
I was lucky enough to be part of TBEX 2016 Philippines in Manila and these are the 5 most important lessons I learned. The whole event was amazing and happy to be part of it. For any aspiring travel blogger, you can learn a lot here and make a lot of new contacts.
Besides that, the weekend in Manila was great and now it's time to push on and explore the rest of the Philippines!

FAQ:

How did you learn to edit?
I taught myself. I downloaded Premiere Pro and began to figure out how to use it through trial and error. My videos were pretty bad at first but eventually, and with the help of many tutorials, you start to figure out what works.

Premiere Pro Link: http://bit.ly/2aBTPiy

What work are you doing?
I started off running this video blog while doing freelance web design and video editing to supplement my travelling lifestyle. I now rely solely on this blog to generate revenue through advertising, affiliate links, Patreon and sponsorship opportunities.

How do you meet the people in your videos?
Hostels, guesthouses and conversations! You meet people so easily while travelling. Just open yourself up and you will meet all sorts of amazing people.
'
Where do you live?
I now live in Indonesia while travelling to lots of destinations. I have a flat in Jakarta and I regularly return there.

We started Gott Love on our wedding day, November 22, 2014. We moved to Okinawa, Japan for a year and a half together, explored as much as possible, vacationed Asia, and then we moved to Las Vegas, Nevada! We love to explore and have big dreams to travel the world full time. Kyle finished a 6-year enlistment in the Air Force in October 2018 and we dove into becoming full-time travelers. We are travel nomads now exploring the world. We love seeing new things and meeting new people and we hope you enjoy our YouTube channel as much as we do! Join the journey of us doing long-term travel and full-time travel and we work and travel the world! Thank you for watching!",8gxfBg4dqnU,29533,Japan,2016

After that, we travel down the street to the Camps de Luca tailoring house to visit with Julian and Charles De Luca about the Stark and Sons suit that is being made. Ready to grab a bit of food we travel to a famous sandwich shop down the street called La Petit Vendome for a ham and cheese sandwich on a baguette.

5548,Travel Blogging - How to successfully pitch brands,/watch?v=cy4tsZ9rAVc,travel blog,"One question that haunts every travel content creator is how to get on board with a brand that sees value in their work and gives them the freedom to execute it their way. Why is it that some content creators who neither have too much experience nor too many followers can crack a deal whereas seasoned professionals might not.

This session will delve into all that and will answer four key questions - WHY, HOW, WHAT and WHERE to pitch the brands. The presentation flow will be as following:

1) Introduction:  will present the 2016's biggest and buzziest global campaign - Coca-Cola relaunch

2) Connection Planning: How Coca-Cola connects with the audience in a more meaningful and engaging way, where each connection point is an opportunity to improve the brand health.

3) WHY brands look for influencers: Reach, Resonance, and Relevance (will share real-life examples - Coca-Cola #ThatsGold campaign, Lyndia.com Skill campaign and Zara #iamdenim campaign)

4) HOW brands choose influencers: the influencer pyramid, niche over mass, engagement over reach and long-term association over short-term campaigns (will share examples for all).

5) WHAT do brands expect from an influencer: practical tips

6) WHERE to start and get noticed: 10 points to remember shared by a successful influencer who is just 22 and is already working with reputed brands (we can keep him as a surprise factor)

7) Q & A


Session Takeaways
Inside information shared by a professional who has been on the other side of the table choosing the influencers. Attendees will carry following takeaways from the session:

1) WHY brands look for influencers

2) HOW brands choose influencers

3) WHAT do brands expect from an influencer

How do bloggers make money?

I love, absolutely love reading about success stores of people starting a website, putting in the hard work for years and building wealth for themselves while producing a lot of value for everyone else.

This video is based of this Reddit post: https://goo.gl/VTxqGi
The website in question is: https://practicalwanderlust.com/

Practical Wanderlust is a site that knows what it is. Practical travel advice, a little bit of story telling and a whole lot of work to make travel content that is insanely helpful. In the post she breaks down how she make money from blogging.

As someone who loves to travel, I sincerely appreciate the design and work ethic she has put into her blog. Anyways, enjoy the video :)

How do bloggers make money from blogging?

Her main sources of income are advertising at over 3k a month as well as professional writing gigs at 3k a month. This is followed up by affiliate marketing for another 3k. Of this affiliate marketing, about half is from Amazon and the other half are various other programs.

5554,🎥 Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog Colombo - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food Sri Lanka,/watch?v=cKk1YSv2fFg,travel blog,"► SUBSCRIBE to lots of new videos every week: http://bit.ly/htcgYTsub

🎥 Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food - Local market in a small village just outside Negombo. Every village has a market day, lots of dried fish and fresh vegetables. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgreat/posts - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgreatcurry/ - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",cKk1YSv2fFg,372650,India,2017

5570,Kollur Mookambika temple darshanam  ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ LIVE Karnataka travel blog,/watch?v=uTiF5grxxCs,travel blog,"The Kollur Mookambika Temple/ ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ at Kollur, Udupi District in the state of Karnataka, India, is a Hindu temple dedicated to mother parvati Devi known as Mookambika Devi. Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.
Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.

The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.

As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess’ anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",uTiF5grxxCs,343730,India,2018

Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling – hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book “1000 Days of Spring” and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.

5576,🎥 Sri Lankan Fish Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Trincomalee Vlog Street Food - Trinco,/watch?v=yy4yduVcYr0,travel blog,"🎥 Trincomalee Fish Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food - Fish Markets Trinco - Trincomalee (Tamil: திருகோணமலை Tirukōṇamalai, Sinhalese: ත්‍රිකුණාමළය Trikuṇāmalaya) also known as Gokanna, is the administrative headquarters of the Trincomalee District and major resort port city of Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. Located on the east coast of the island overlooking the Trincomalee Harbour, 113 miles south of Jaffna and 69 miles north of Batticaloa, Trincomalee has been one of the main centres of Sri Lankan Tamil language speaking culture on the island for over two millennia. With a population of 99,135, the city is built on a peninsula of the same name, which divides its inner and outer harbours. People from Trincomalee are known as Trincomalians and the local authority is Trincomalee Urban Council. Trincomalee city is home to the famous Koneswaram temple alluded to in its historic Tamil name Thirukonamalai and is home to other historical monuments such as the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee, the Trincomalee Hindu Cultural Hall and, opened in 1897, the Trincomalee Hindu College. Trincomalee is also the site of the Trincomalee railway station and an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur. The recorded history of Trincomalee spans more than two and a half thousand years, beginning with civilian settlement associated with the Koneswaram temple in the pre-modern era. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it has served as a major maritime seaport in the international trading history of the island with South East Asia. In the ancient world, it was successively the capital of eastern kingdoms of the Vanni country, developing under the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pallava Dynasty, Chola Dynasty, Pandyan Dynasty, the Vannimai chieftaincies and the Jaffna kingdom through the Koneswaram shrine's revenue. Trincomalee's urbanization continued when made into a fortified port town following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, changing hands between the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French following a battle of the American Revolutionary War and the British in 1795, being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The city's architecture shows some of the best examples of interaction between native and European styles. Attacked by the Japanese as part of the Indian Ocean raid during World War II in 1942, the city and district were affected after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, when the political relationship between Tamil and Sinhalese people deteriorated, erupting into civil war. It is home to major naval and air force bases at the Trincomalee Garrison. The city also has the largest Dutch fort on the island. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgreat/posts - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgreatcurry/ - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",yy4yduVcYr0,31546,India,2017

5584,Blogger Base at ITB Berlin 2018 - for Travel Bloggers and Influencers,/watch?v=TdNiIYyBJYk,travel blog,"Blogger Base took place at ITB Berlin for the first time this year, March 2018. Blogger Base was designed as a dedicated workspace for travel bloggers and travel influencers to hang-out, network and re-charged their devices. Blogger Base is part of a wider travel blogger program at ITB Berlin, which includes the Travel Blogger Speed Dating or Speed Networking session as well as the blogger presentations on the eTravel World stage.
https://www.itb-berlin.de/en/Visitors/TradeVisitors/Blogger/
Read our blog listing all the travel social media and digital marketing conference around the world.
https://www.travelmedia.ie/blog/travel-social-media-digital-marketing-conferences/
Video transcript:
- - ITB Berlin's one of the most professional events on my calendar so I'll have to be here. It's just a really awesome event. - Actually I live here in Berlin and I come because it's important to make contacts and network with other bloggers. - First of all, I'm German so I want to come to Berlin to meet with the German brands and second of all it's the largest tourism fair in the world and that's why I definitely want to come. - So ITB decided to set up the ITB Blogger Base due to the high demand that we saw during the last few years. First of all, the amount of bloggers raised a lot so we even see the number of bloggers grow more than journalists so we said, ""Okay, we need to give them a place to blog."" You know, community is really, really important for them so this is the place. This is the Blogger Base and we're really happy it worked out so well. - I have been to the Blog Base. It's an upgrade from last year. We've got proper chairs, we've got WiFi, we've got charging stations and even a nice cup of tea. - I like the idea of Blogger Base a lot because it's always great to network with other bloggers. Connect with them, see what they're doing. Learn from each other and great networking. - Blogger Base is a great idea. It makes you to communicate with other bloggers, to have a better interaction with them and to get to know each other also. - Blogger Base, it's a good chance to meet your colleagues catch up about the day, recharge your devices and also just have a space to work because as everyone knows, it's super busy on the floor and it's bustling and crazy and lots of people and there's never really a chance anywhere to sit down and catch up on your work because ultimately, while we're here, we still have our work that we have to complete and emails to catch up on so it's a good space to relax. - Travel blogger, ITB's the biggest travel conference right now, in the world and it's a good chance to meet companies to meet other bloggers that do the same what you love to do. - So the ITB Blogger Speed Dating is 90 minutes of high speed dating quality. So what happens is, we have approximately 180 bloggers this year who get together with 180 exhibitors from ITB Berlin and they get eight minutes each to pitch their blog, to pitch their company, and then see if it's a match. We do have a pre-set matching schedule. The system, you can filter what you would like, what you're interested in and then you can pre-match already. So, you come to the Blogger Speed Dating and you have nine meetings, eight minutes time and hopefully a lot of corporations. - It's really great value, the contacts. Because, some of them contact you so they usually follow up with it. Especially the German destinations. And I always get good corporations out of it. - Speed networking is kind of important for me. I mean, it's the first introduction to meet new people. It's like a good, quick introduction and then you can build up on it. So from that perspective, it's important. Yes. - It's fantastic. It's such a great opportunity to meet people face to face. It's the one reason you come to ITB. is to get that face to face meeting. Even if it's for a few minutes. Invaluable for me as a blogger. It's one of the reasons I love coming back here. - I do do the speed networking at ITB. Again, this is an opportunity where you have a chance to meet maybe up to 10 people within a small space of time. It can be a little bit more easier than running around all the halls and trying to pre-plan meetings. It's very targeted. They come to you or you go to them and there is a chance to do a miniature pitch within that set-up. For me, that will be my biggest afternoon here. I'm seeing lots of people that I genuinely really want to have a chat with. - Besides the ITB Blogger Base that we created newly this year and the Bloggers Speed Networking which was really successful, part of the ITB Convention is the e-Travel World so what happens in the e-Travel World, it's all about travel technology and of course, bloggers are a huge topic at the e-Travel World. There's some bloggers giving advice to the companies on how to work with bloggers. It's a lot about influencer marketing. How can companies work with bloggers to create good content and things like that.",TdNiIYyBJYk,935,,2018

We vlogged (video blogged) our day trip to Giethoorn, also widely regarded as Venice of The Netherlands or Venice of the North. We rented boats and toured the canals of the city.

Giethoorn is charming with many channels and boats. Many tourists come here to relax and go to the nearby national park.

About a year ago Chinese tourists discovered Giethoorn. They come by tourist buses or local buses. The whole city is getting adjusted to the Chinese tourists, they are learning Chinese, have Chinese written menus and signs, and even the bus tickets for the public transport buses are now written in Chinese. But not only does Chinese tourists come here, Indians, Americans, Thai and other tourists started to discover Giethoorn too.

5599,San Diego Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,/watch?v=-KMZW_zwRfc,travel blog,"http://www.expedia.com/San-Diego.d178304.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to San Diego, often called the birthplace of California.

Start your San Diego tour with a stop in Old Town, a historic park filled with buildings dating back to the 1820s. If you want something a little livelier, go a few miles south to check out the Gaslamp District, full of Victorian-era architecture and a thriving bar and club scene. Bringing the kids with you, or looking for a more sedate afternoon? Stop by the San Diego Zoo and spend some time with the many animals taking up residence there – including some of the few pandas outside of China.

Explore San Diego’s ties to the sea by touring the U.S.S. Midway, Navy Pier, and Maritime Museum. From there, it’s just a skip across the bay to Coronado, where you can lay out in the sun and soak up some rays in a quiet beach town.

Round out your day with a trip to “the jewel,” better known as La Jolla, and indulge in some of the best seafood and Mexican food you’ll find anywhere. Don’t forget to say “Hi” to the sea lions.

Visit our San Diego travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

Welcome to Los Angeles, the “Capital of the Creative World.”

Los Angeles tours begin and end with the unique culture of the city and county. You will never experience another locale so devoted to the creation of art across all of its mediums. Visit the Getty Museum to see the sprawling collection of John Paul Getty. Take in the restored grandeur of Union Station – featured in numerous films – and then head for the world’s most famous zip code, 90210. Your trip to Beverly Hills will naturally include a stop at Rodeo Drive, where you can shop till you drop.

Los Angeles sightseeing is not complete without a stop at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where you can see the handprints of your favorite stars. Don’t forget to get a picture with the legendary Hollywood sign in the background, or take a trip to one of the many famous theme parks around the city.

Pack your bags and grab your camera, and use our Los Angeles travel guide to plan your next trip.

SIM CARD
Another options is to get a SIM card for your unlocked mobile device.  You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I’ll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.

(1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.

(2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn’t have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days, you can just buy a new card.

Mombasa is a beautiful city located in Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. It’s a melting pot of a city, full of culture and delicious food. In this video, I met up with Farhana and Samil, both from Mombasa, and both love to eat.

Lighthouse - First place we headed on this Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa is along the coast called Mama Ngina drive, or Lighthouse. You’ll find an abundance of small snacks along the road with a view over the cliffs of the Indian ocean. Probably my favorite street food was the fried cassava chips, which are fried fresh, put into bags, then seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime juice.

Here are the main street food snacks we had:
Coconut, heart of palm, cassava - 340 KES ($3.33) total
Cassava chips
Roasted and fried cassava
Coconuts
Sweet potato, corn, many things

Next we headed into the heart of Mombasa to eat from a roadside shop selling a mixture of bhajias, fried potatoes, and fried chilies. This is legendary street food in Mombasa! When you order she puts all the fried things onto a plate and douses them in coconut chutney and hot sauce. The combination is delicious, and  my favorite item was the fried chilies.
Bhajia plate combo - 90 KES ($0.88)

Azad Ice Cream - We then had sugarcane juice, a Mombasa Kenyan favorite. They added sugarcane, plus ginger and lime.

Damascus Shawarma - 200 KES ($1.96) - One of the popular food trucks in Mombasa is Damascus shawarma. It was pretty good.

Abbasi Darbar - To finish off this Kenyan food tour of Mombasa, we ended with a  mega meat feast at Abbasi Darbar, a great place to fulfill all your meat needs. We ordered most of what they offer on the menu. Everything was delicious,  but I think the winner for me was the spring chicken tikka.
Total price - 1,900 KES ($18.64)

Again, thank you for Farhana for taking me on this amazing Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa, Kenya. Be sure to check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruHCa93z0-aV1DjdYtlPXQ

5621,"Family Travel Blog-Becoming Part of That Noise- Magdalena, Lima, Peru",/watch?v=KoQbfOaZZFQ,travel blog,"http://www.thenomadicfamily.com.

So, again, I'm happy. I like it when I'm happy. Beaming, shining, gushing about how really nothing at all brings me enormous joy. And here, we've been invited by friends to a festival. Authentic, genuine, super cool. We were the only, only, only non-locals there, and I love those moments. When we are just honored enough, lucky enough to be around kind-hearted people who extend an invitation of love to us.

By the way, my hair looks unbelievably stunning.( I know it's not related to anything I am trying to share with you, but a- my vanity is alas, mine and b- my mind does that four hundred times a second). I loved that short little period of time between attempt number one and attempt number two for purple hair. When I got the most-amazing-I-have-ever-gotten-in-my-life-haircut. . I looked soooo good. Now, sitting here in Cambodia with my fried-bleach-blonde-highlights-after-the-purple-attempt-number-two-faded hair and thinking how much I'd love that amazing hairdresser in Lima, Peru to fix my hair up again. These days it is in a bun or a ponytail all day. Advantages to that are that now my family can tell me all day, ""Girl, yo ponytail from the back looks riDicUlous! ""

So, where were we.... annoying-as-hell fly won't leave me alone. I am practicing ahima (nonharm to all beings) so trying not to swat it to DEATH! but it won't let me be. It will end up being one of those ,""Look what you made me do!"" tragedies in my life.

So, Magdalena Art Festival, yes.

Travel video about destination Kolkata in India.
Calcutta, or Kolkata as it has been known since 2001, is the capital of West Bengal and also the second largest city in India.

A city of contrasts that could not be more striking with slums, poverty and degrading conditions, while nearby, the wealthy enjoy all the finer things of life. Once a humble village on the Hooghly River, Kolkata became the capital of British India.

Close to the Victoria Memorial is the Orient's first Anglican cathedral, St. Paul's, a remarkable sacred building. Of Indo-Gothic design, it was built between 1839 and 1847 and is a legacy of British colonial rule on the banks of the Gulf of Bengal. The red brick Writers´ Building was formerly the headquarters of the East India Company and it was from there that trade was carried out across the entire world. It was also the administrative centre for Bengal, Burma and Pakistan.

Kalighat is the oldest pilgrimage destination in the world. Narrow pathways lead to a Shiva temple along with stalls selling souvenirs and religious offerings.T he sanctuary was built in 1809 and is still busy today as taxis and bicycle rickshaws wait for the thousands of pilgrims that go there each day. In Kolkata, the Hindu doctrine of a better life after rebirth is, for many, the only hope that they can cling to.

Nevertheless, Kolkata is one of the most fascinating metropolises in the world and also one in which chaos reigns supreme!

50 Things to do in Paris, France | Top Attractions Travel Guide Travel Video Transcript:

Hello, and welcome to Paris. This week we are exploring the city of love, city of lights and city of art. This video will be showing you the top 50 things to do while you visit Paris.

So we're wrapping things up here. What would be your one tip for visiting Paris? Well, I have recently spent a whole ten days here in summer. I would say that if you really want to visit the art galleries, the museums and all of the main attractions you should probably avoid summer and like either come in the spring or the fall or even winter. Because the lines are insane and sometimes you have to wait like an hour and a half or two hours.

So how about you? What are your final thoughts on Paris? So my finals thoughts is obviously Paris is one of the top cities in the world in terms of attractions. There is going to be garbage, there is going to be lines, there is going to be some areas that are a bit of an eyesore. But there is also a lot of beauty and there is also a lot to do here.

And that concludes our guide of the top 50 things to do and see in Paris. We hope you enjoyed watching, and let us know if there are other places you would add to this list.

This is part of our Travel in France series showcasing French culture, French arts, French foods & French cuisine.

In this Chinese Street Food tour video, I'm going to take you on a food street journey to many delicious, mouthwatering street food places around Beijing, AKA Peking, in Northern China. If you're thinking about traveling to China for the street food, make sure to come visit Beijing. You can enjoy unique Chinese street foods hidden in Beijing's Hutong Alleyways and try some classic Chinese cuisine favorites like Peking duck AKA Beijing duck, Jian bing ( 煎饼) AKA Chinese crepes, and a ton of other hidden specialties.
 In the past 3 years, I've shot and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world!

Chinese cuisine is so fantastic, it would really take a lifetime to eat all of it. I consider myself super lucky and fortunate to be able to live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, eating Sichuan food and sampling food across the whole country whenever I get the chance. I've decided to stay living in China for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!

Here are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Chinese street food I had in this Beijing travel video. Most locations were deep in Beijing's Hutong alleyways!

1) Famous beijing breakfast Jianbing - AKA Chinese Crepe
北京市东城区大兴胡同内。
2) Delicious Sesame butter porridge made from millet AKA Miancha:
北京市东城区南大兴胡同7号
3) Very stinky Douzhi fermented green bean porridge (even stinkier than stinky tofu!)
北京市东城区天坛北门对面老磁器口豆汁店
4) Organ soup and specialty Beijing zhajiang noodles AKA Zhajiangmian!
北京市东城区东四北大街141号老北京百年卤煮店
5) Beijing Duck / Peking duck!
.北京市东城区北新桥头条55号花家怡园

Our visit London travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts, entertainment, museums, nightlife and restaurants in London. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or London city guide.

50 Things to do in London Travel Guide | Top Attractions London City Guide Transcript:

So Hello from London! Time for a new destination. This is a city that I haven't visited in almost 4 years. So we're both very excited to be in London. And we're going to be making a little video guide. Actually a really big video guide because we plan on showing you 50 different things to do around London.

Our first stop was Trafalgar Square. This square leads to a lot of central attractions, so it's a nice place to people watch, get your bearings, and plan out where you want to go in the city.

The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the Thames. It offers a bird's eye view of the city.

Buckingham Palace has served as the official London residence for Britain's sovereigns since 1837. The State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open to visitors every year.

The Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament, is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Palace along with Big Ben are two of the top London attractions that dot the city-scape.

The Tower of London sits on the north bank of the River Thames.

And that's a wrap for London! Like with any mega city, it's impossible to cover all the sights and attractions you can enjoy here, but hopefully this video will give you an idea of what London has to offer.

This is part of our Travel in England series showcasing English culture, English foods, English cuisine and English people.

Banana beach
Banana Beach is a small bay, located in the north-west of the island between the beaches of Bang Tao and Nai Thon. This stunningly beautiful place with azure sea and picturesque wooden Longboat. Ideal for photos. The video is not imposed a single filter, the water in the reality of such a color. For this I love the Andaman Sea.

This month I bring you the one and only Alysse Hotz! When she isn't hanging out around a campfire talking shit, shes usually at the crag...talking shit.
Her rainbow kitten unicorn meets foul-mouthed badass aesthetic is just one of her many charming and unique qualities.
She is an all-around badass who is currently getting her PHD in literature and has achieved the much coveted sustainable nomadic existence by renting out her apartment on Air BnB and doing freelance writing for a tech company.
Alysse is a hilarious, generous, and all around fun person to hang out with. If you see her on the road or at the crag give her a high five, cheers her, or offer to give her a belay because Alysse is someone you definitely want in your crew.

If you want to see more of Alysse you can find her on Instagram at @RainbowUniCatVan

5645,The Maldives Travel Blog - Part 1 | Louise Cooney,/watch?v=Jvkj_rXj9cQ,travel blog,"Hi guys,

Here is a look at our first three days in the Maldives. It was a quick turnaround from Dubai (I literally got straight back off the plane I came off - definitely could have planned that better). But oh my god, it was so worth the travelling. It's just out of this world.

Click here to see more info on the trip so far: http://louisecooney.com/2018/07/the-maldives-first-impressions/

We have 3 more days here in a different resort so I'll be sure to vlog that to so I can show you (and look back on) everything,

Thanks for watching,

I was born in Key West, Florida, and we moved to Saint Augustine, FL when I was 6, after about 10 years of my parents working at a water sports business in the Keys.

I traveled all over Italy and Europe, with only the intention to stay for a few months, when I friend of mine I had made offered me work. My goal is to give people down-to-earth travel advice, tips, and tricks.  I want to share my own unique story of how I came to be where I am now. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I want to help people find their own way, with the help of my logical travel advice.

5660,50 THINGS TO DO IN NEW YORK CITY | Top Attractions Travel Guide,/watch?v=OvXGh_Pv6qg,travel blog,"Our recent week in New York City was an action-packed one. We decided to set ourselves a challenge to see and do as much as we possibly could, and that gave way to this travel video guide which highlights 50 of the top attractions. In a city like New York this means we barely scratched the surface, but hopefully this video will highlight the cornucopia of possibilities that is the Big Apple.

50 Take the Subway Metro

Most journeys begin at Penn Station or Grand Central, and if you arrive at the later you'll be wowed by the building. The Meatpacking District was once home to markets, slaughterhouses, and packaging plants, but times have changed. Today you'll find a mixture of trendy restaurants, clubs and boutiques. The Village used to be a bohemian neighborhood that drew artists and musicians, but today you're more likely to find upper middle class families living here. Completed in 1883, Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. Williamsburg has become popular given its lower rent prices. University students and young professionals have been flocking to this part of town.
You can walk along the riverfront for a great view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges and the Manhattan skyline. During the summer months, Bryant Park also becomes a popular hangout spot people looking to relax and even work on their tans. The Staten Island Ferry is free of charge and this makes it really popular with visitors who want to catch a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty from a distance. Battery Park is located on the southern tip of Manhattan. Having both lived in South Korea, we were thrilled to come across Manhattan's own Little Korea. Coney Island is all about good old fashioned fun. The Cloisters will make you feel like you've travelled over to Europe. Central Park is massive and there are so many places to visit within its boundaries. We managed to visit Belvedere Castle, the Great Lawn, Shakespeare Garden, The Ramble, The Jackie Onassis Reservoir, the Alice in Wonderland Statue, and we still left feeling like we barely scratched the surface.

And that concludes a look at our very busy week in New York City. I'm still shocked we managed to cover so many attractions, but the great thing about this city is that distances aren't very long and there's always something really cool worth checking out around each corner.

Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for a new day and new adventure!!!

How to Vlog? This is the question I asked myself as I started out the new year. I am always looking to be more creative and I decided that this year will be the year that I start a daily vlog. So sitback and step into my daily life.

Vlogging is totally new to me, but I hope to bring you on all my travels, adventures and all around exploring.

A little bit about myself:
I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.

My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon. We traveled to last year all around Mexico, China, Bali, Hawaii and throughout California and Neveda. I am hoping that 2016 will bring more excitement and more travels, so be sure to subscribe :)

5667,24 Hours in MADRID. Madrid Travel Blog,/watch?v=hxraAUbqcEo,travel blog,"We spend just 24 hours exploring the beautiful city of Madrid, Spain! We start off in one
of the main squares of the city and eventually make our way to the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Sabatini Gardens. Later we take a run through Parque Del Oeste and find the Temple de Debod.

As the capital city, a cosmopolitan city, a business center, seat of government, Spanish Parliament, and residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political centre of Spain. Madrid is characterized by intense cultural and artistic activity and a very lively nightlife.

Madrid, Spain

According to legend the original name of the city was ""Ursaria"" (""land of bears"" in Latin), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the arbutus (""madroño"" in Spanish), have been the emblem (The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city from the Middle Ages

Paseo del Arte

In English, the Art walk, is a place for beauty and art like no other in Europe. In only 1 kilometre, you will come across one of the most important museums in the world; Prado Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Reina Sofia Museum.  Beside this, you will find gardens, historic streets, science centres and libraries. If you don’t have enough time, try to go there! You will experience the best Madrid can offer.

TOP 5 in Madrid:

Puerta del Sol

Puerta del Sol is one of Madrid’s most visited squares. The square is surrounded by many small and historical streets such as Calle Arena and others. Puerta del Sol is a great place to start a walk around the most traditional places in Madrid.

Cibeles Fountain

Built in 1782, it has become a symbol of the capital. The fountain is built around the Roman goddess Cybele; symbol of the earth, agriculture and fertility. The goddess is depicted being carried by golden lions. Definitely a great palace to visit.

Plaza Mayor

This square is part of the old part of the city. Plaza Mayor demonstrate the old architecture in Madrid; narrow streets, alleys and passageways, which were once used by swashbuckling swordsmen and medieval rogues.  Plaza Mayor is also well known to be the place for the best open restaurants and bars around this beautiful part of Madrid.

Royal Palace

The largest palace in Europe, this place was home to the majority of the kings of Spain; from Charles III to Alfonso XIII. Nowadays, although the royal family does not longer live there, it is still used during important visits. The best thing about the royals palace; you can visit it yourself. A great way to admire the best of European architecture.

Her (Kerala)Chilled Rivers are full of fishes which fly up and down with zealous..

ഇടവപ്പാതിമഴതൻ
പ്രളയതാഡനത്താൽ
നാം തളർനിടുമോ?
നാം  തളർനിടുമോ?
Do we wreck in the lashes of Monsoon Rain Floods ?
തളരാതെ ഉയരും നാം
തകരാതെ ഉയരും നാം (2)
We will together rise up without tedium
We will together rise up without crumbling

നാം ഉയരും  ഒന്നായി ഉയരെ ഉയരും
നവകേരളമായി ഉയരും

We will fly high with unity to rebuild our state...

3) ട്രെയിനിൽ ജനറൽ കമ്പാർട്ട്മെന്റ് ഉണ്ട്, അതിന്റെ ടിക്കറ്റ് ലഭിക്കാൻ റെയിൽവേ സ്റ്റേഷനിൽ അതിരാവിലെ 3 മണി മുതൽ ക്യൂ ഉണ്ടാകും, അവധി ദിവസങ്ങളിൽ ഇത്തരത്തിൽ ടിക്കറ്റുകൾ കിട്ടുവാൻ ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടും, ഇടദിവസം ആണെങ്കിൽ എളുപ്പം ആയിരിക്കും.

4) ഫസ്റ്റ് ക്ലാസ്സ് കോച്ചിൽ ഏറ്റവും മുന്നിലത്തെ കൂപ്പയാണ് ട്രെയിനിന്റെ ഏറ്റവും മുന്നിലുള്ളത്, ഏറ്റവും കൂടുതൽ വ്യൂ ലഭിക്കുന്നതും ഇവിടെ നിന്നാണ്.

5) മേട്ടുപ്പാളയം നിന്നും മുകളിലേക്ക് പോകുമ്പോൾ ട്രെയിനിന്റെ ഇടത് വശത്ത് ഇരിക്കുവാൻ ശ്രദ്ധിക്കുക.

6) ഏറ്റവും ഭംഗിയുള്ള സ്ഥലം മേട്ടുപ്പാളയം മുതൽ കൂണൂർ വരെയുള്ള യാത്രയാണ്.

7) കൂനൂർ മുതൽ ഊട്ടി വരെ ഡീസൽ എഞ്ചിൻ വെച്ചുള്ള യാത്രയാണ്, ഈ സെക്ടറിൽ ട്രെയിനുകൾ കൂടുതലുണ്ട്, പെട്ടന്ന് ടിക്കറ്റുകൾ ലഭിക്കും, പക്ഷെ മേട്ടുപ്പാളയത്ത് നിന്നും യാത്ര ചെയ്യുന്നതിന്റെ നൂറിൽ ഒന്ന് പോലും ഭംഗിയില്ല.

8) സ്റ്റേഷനുകളിൽ വണ്ടി നിർത്തുമ്പോൾ കുരങ്ങന്മാരെ ശ്രദ്ധിക്കുക, അറ്റാക്ക് ചെയ്യാൻ സാധ്യതയുണ്ട്.

കൂടുതൽ കാഴ്ചകൾ കണ്ട് അനുഭവിക്കുവാൻ വീഡിയോ കാണുക. ആനക്കട്ടിയിലുള്ള SR Jungle Resort ന്റെ കൂടുതൽ വിവരങ്ങൾക്ക് വിളിക്കാം: 9659850555

5814,ഒരു ലോക്കൽ മസ്കറ്റ്‌ വ്ലോഗ്‌ - Muttrah Souk - Oman by Tech Travel Eat,/watch?v=afZVg9-7g4Y,travel blog,"മസ്‌കറ്റിലെ മാത്രാ സൂക്ക് - ഒമാനി കരകൗശലവസ്തുക്കളും സുഗന്ധ ദ്രവ്യങ്ങളും മറ്റനേകം വ്യത്യസ്ത കാഴ്ചകളും കാണാം. - Muttrah Souk - Oman by Tech Travel Eat

Al Dhalam (Darkness in Arabic) Souq is the local name for the Muttrah Souq. The Muttrah Souq is perhaps one of the oldest marketplaces in the Arab world. It is located adjacent to the harbour of Muscat harbour and has seen an immense trade in the age of sail, being strategically located on the way to India and China. It has been named after darkness because of the crowded stalls and lanes where the sunrays do not infiltrate during the day and the shoppers need lamps to know their destinations. The name of the market has been drawn specifically from the part that extends from Al Lawatiya Mosque to Khour Bimba where the place is really full of stores and stalls and the narrow area of lanes does not allow the sunlight to enter. The market was a source of supply for Omanis where they can buy their needs in the 1960s when life requirements were simpler than today. Most of the goods were imported, in addition to local products like textiles, fruit, vegetables and dates.

Ananthapuri Restaurant, located near Darsait Roundabout, opposite Muscat Municipality, part of Al Shorouq Group of Companies, celebrated their first anniversary in traditional style in their restaurant premises last week. It was a momentous occasion for the management and staff at Ananthapuri, heart filled with joy to be amongst their patrons and well-wishers amidst an exciting journey commenced on 07 December 2008.

Ananthapuri Restaurant has earned a unique position in Muscat – a place that is synonymous to Taste, Tradition, Ambience and Agility in Service. It is a theme restaurant who serves authentic South Indian dishes along with a variety of options in North Indian and Chinese cuisine. We have regular and growing customers for our South Indian Thali served every afternoon between 12.30 PM to 3 PM. We are conscious to instil variety in our dishes whilst carefully implementing valuable suggestions we zealously collect from our customers; indeed a feel at home experience….! Dinner at our restaurant is very popular as we embrace the challenge to satisfy the choices and options of our food loving customers. We are indebted to their preference for Ananthapuri and equally committed to entertaining them with mouth-watering delicacies from our kitchen.

Aruvikkuzhy Falls is a waterfall about 100 feet high located about 2km from Thadiyoor and 7km from Kozhencherry in the Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India. It is now becoming a popular tourist destination.

Aruvikkuzhi is a beautiful picnic spot and an ideal shooting location for movies located in Kottayam. Aruvikkuzhi Waterfalls, falling in five steps, is a real feast for the eyes. Here streams make their way through the landscape and the water roars as it cascades down the mountains from a height of 100 ft. It is an ideal place for trekking and is located in the midst of rubber plantations.

St. Mary’s Church is situated at the top of the waterfalls. The rubber plantation centre at Pallickathod, is just 1 km from this spot

Mahe is a small place located in between Kozhikode and Kannur district in Kerala which is a part of Union Territory Pondicherry. Petroleum products and liquor are cheaper in Mahe. So it is advisable to fill fuel from Mahe.

The main attraction of Mahe is the seaside walkway, light house and St Teresa's Shrine. Mahe railway station still has the old style board and written the Malayalam name ""Mayyazhi"" on it. Mahe is well connected by road & train. The nearest airport is Kozhikode.

After visiting Mahe, I moved to Thalassery. There I visited the famous Thalassery Sea Bridge. The bridge is really in a bad state and authorities must have to look into it to make some necessary maintenance to keep it safe.

My next video is of Muzhuppilangadu Beach and it is one of the best driving beaches in India.

I have decided to go for a road trip from my home in Kozhencherry to Goa via Kochi, Kozhikode and it was my first day I started from my home and drove till Kozhikode. Reached Kozhikode by 11.30 Pm and I was tired and had to stay there overnight.

It was difficult to get a room because it was a weekend and finally I had to pay Rs. 1250 for an AC room in a hotel called Metro Lodge which was located near to the KSRTC Bus station in Kozhikode. The room was not up to the mark and the service was pathetic. The booking was done through Makemytrip website.

Next day morning we started from there and moved to Mahe. Enroute we just dropped into Kozhikode beach and Kappad beach. Kozhikode beach usually doesn't get crowded in the morning but a favourite place for locals to hang out and do the exercise, sports coaching etc. We then moved to Kappad beach which is 20 Km far from there and Kappad beach.

Our next destination was Thalassery & Mahe and videos will be coming soon on this channel. Do subscribe for more updates.

These ships are operating by State Water Transport Corporation, and the charges are extremely less. It was just Rs. 4 for a 20+ minute boat ride. I was kind of got stuck in Ernakulam boat jetty by not getting the tickets to come back. There was a huge rush of people who wanted to go to Mattancherry and Fort Kochi. I waited for almost 10 minutes and was getting delayed a lot.

Later I decided to catch an Uber Taxi to Vypin island where they have a Jangaar service to Fort Kochi. I booked a taxi, and it took 15 minutes to reach Vypin ferry. From there I boarded the Jangaar by paying Rs. 3 and reached back at Fort Kochi where my car was parked. Jangaar is usually used to ferry vehicles as well as to carry passengers from Fort Kochi to Vypin Island.

Overall it was an unplanned incident and took almost two hours to finish a round trip. For more details visit us on http://www.techtraveleat.com

I was in search of a software which can easily resize my images and batch watermarking it to protect my images from online theft. I was using Adobe Photoshop to do the same so far and was spending half of my working time for it.

I had to upload a lot of photographs to my travel blog articles, especially for hotel reviews. So using Adobe Photoshop for a large number of conversion find it difficult for me. And I have stumbled upon this ""Visual Watermark"" software and decided to try it.",bZYOzrZKmUk,8004,,2016

I am using Reliance Jio sim since the preview offer started and was pretty much happy with the service. But the problem has started a few weeks ago that I am not able to make any calls even when I haven't used any data on that particular day.

Whenever I am trying to make calls, It needs at least 5 minutes for getting the call connected. And that really make you angry.

Here is a video which I have taken now when I tried to make a call with Reliance Jio sim, and later I ended up making the call with my Vodafone Postpaid connection.

So guys, let us just figure out how Reliance is gonna rule the world if things are going like this?

Dear Reliance Team, Do you think people will come towards you after you end up giving the free data/call offer if things are going like this?",qdFqlABKPiY,2708,,2016

Karnataka, with its 320-kilometer coastline, has many popular beaches. Among the many beaches in Karnataka, Ullal Beach is arguably one of the best. Stretched out in a hue of blue and green, this beach is a prime tourist attraction of the state.

Sri Somanatha Someshwara Temple is located near Someshwar beach in Ullal, at a distance of about 13 kms from Mangalore. Because of this temple, this place is called as Someshwara.

It is a beautiful Shiva Temple located near the sea shore. This is One of the most famous temples of Mangalore situated right at the sea shore with a wide beach view.

Normally morning & evening time is good to visit the temple. Evening time is best if you are planning to visit the beach also.  One of the temple approaches has a staircase climb, one might have to look for the alternate approach to go up towards the other entrance to avoid the climb. You can take your vehicle up and park it there.

The view from Temple is awesome, there are rocks to sit and beach is clean. Tides are high most of the time, so avoid swimming here.

The temple is not much crowded, It is a calm and peaceful place to enjoy with your family. There are huge rocks on the beach which is unlike other beaches which give a standout view for this place.

It might seem a bit silly but people suffer from this phobia all over the world as they travel. It can be especially annoying when you are on a long haul flight. This article will show you how to get over a fear of the airplane toilet.

1. Get used to the sound of the airplane toilet. The sound of airplane toilets is the part that scares most people. The first thing you can do about it a day before your flight, try listening to airplane toilet flushing noises via YouTube. It will get you used to the sound.
2. Try to avoid using the airplane toilet. On the day of the flight if you suffer from nausea or vomiting (usually called airsickness) get a doctor to prescribe you an air sickness medication ( if needed). This way, if you suffer from that you will feel great and you won’t need to use the airplane toilet excessively.
3. If you are very scared of the noise, try this technique. Use this 3 step system.
1)Go to the bathroom quickly
2) Wash your hands and unlock the door
3) Flush the toilet and get out as soon as possible.
4. If you are still scared of the airplane toilet, use this technique. Bring your iPod in the toilet and play loud music in your ears while you flush. It will drain out the noise and help you get it over with-quickly.

5. Be brave. You can’t get over your fear without bravery.

6. Talk to the flight attendant if you are really scared. Ask a flight attendant to tell you how the airplane toilets are made.



7. Bring a friend to stand outside the door, it may help

8. Dare yourself to stay inside the cubicle while it flushes. When you do, pat yourself on the back because you just overcame your fear of airplane toilets.",Kt8YgPcZTxg,42594,,2016

6179,Paris Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,/watch?v=AQ6GmpMu5L8,travel blog,"http://www.expedia.com/Paris.d179898.Destination-Travel-Guides

Paris, the capital of France, attracts 42 million visitors a year.

You can start your Paris tour on the metro, on foot, or with a taxi or bicycle; the city is easily navigable on all fronts. Visit the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the city and marvel at its graceful lines and commanding presence. Built between 1806 and 1836, the Arc is one of a number of historical arches and landmarks peppering Paris.

If your Paris sightseeing includes purchasing souvenirs, head to the Champs-Élysées, home of boutique shopping, numerous restaurants, and many bars, along with a theatre and other entertaining venues. Learn about culture and creativity at the Louvre, a 14th-century palace turned art museum, and check in on the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile. Notre Dame Cathedral cannot be missed, as this imposing Gothic structure has stood since 1345.

Speaking of imposing, the Eiffel Tower is most frequently used to represent Paris. Stroll beneath it to get a good idea of its height, or travel to the top for a stunning view of the City of Light.

Paris: City of lights! Paris is the capital of the culinary world and food is equally treated as an art form. In this city, each food has its own specializing store: boulangerie, fromagerie and charcuterie. Ishai has 24 hours to dive into the wonderful French cuisine, where he will learn how to make the baguette, smell so many cheeses his senses will go into overload and meet with the famous food critic, Gilles Pudlowski.

6198,45 HOURS LIVING IN AN AIRPLANE,/watch?v=7_8hBszHARY,travel blog,"Después de nuestra aventura en Puerto Vallarta, tenía que seguir mi camino hacia mi siguiente aventura... ASIA!!
Mi viaje por ASIA iniciaría en Seúl, Corea y para llegar ahí, tenía primero que viajar a mi base en Tijuana para lavar ropa, cambiar de equipaje (porque traía puros trajes de baño y necesitaba ropa abrigada), desayunar tacos y saludar a mi papá...
Después de esa escala técnica, volaría a otros dos destinos antes de tomar el último vuelo cruzando el pacífico para llegar a Asia!

En total fueron 5 vuelos pasando más de 45 horas entre aviones y aeropuertos, a veces viajando en primera clase o clase premier (business class), a veces en clase turista... Pero al final VALIÓ LA PENA!

Yo tenía muchas ganas de conocerlo por dentro desde hacía muchos años... Y esta ocasión por primera vez tuve la oportunidad de viajar en uno de ellos para viajar de Kuala Lumpur a México con escala en Londres, una ruta algo larga teniendo en cuenta que era más corto viajar por el pacífico en lugar de dar casi toda la vuelta al planeta...

Being our second time in Paris, we'd been sightseeing before, so we thought we'd take you along with us this time! We started out at the Eiffel Tower before heading over to Champs-Élysées and the Arc De Triomphe for an AMAZING view.

The next day, we made our way over to Palais Royal and The Louvre. It's so incredibly beautiful by those massive pyramids! We couldn't leave without checking out Musée D'Orsay's giant clock and Van Gogh collection, as well as Notre Dame.

I hope you enjoy seeing the sights as much as we did!

6284,RABAT | Study Abroad Blog | Week Long Trip to Paris by Adrienne Lane,/watch?v=mLAcitoeXA4,travel blog,"""I collected this footage during our program’s week-long trip to Paris.  The footage is set to an old funk favorite of mine, ‘Watermelon Man,” from Herbie Hancock’s album Head Hunters. I chose this song because “Watermelon Man” is the shortest yet the catchiest track on the album, even though the entire album is incredible. Likewise, though this entire trip is incredible and all parts of it contribute to its wonder, this one short week in Paris is definitely one to remember.

Yes, we saw all the classic Paris things… I started the video with those clips because it establishes how exciting seeing Paris was for me. Half of us in the program had never been to Paris before, let alone Europe, so we had a lot of surreal feelings. I have been studying French for seven years, and have been learning about Paris since my first semester of my French education in my freshman year of high school… and it took me this long to get here. It was wild how much I had learned about Paris before ever visiting. I had accumulated so much knowledge about the city over long years of vocabulary lists, Parisian literature, and analysis of French politics. Luckily, our program director and North African politics professor were with us, who knew the city very well and were very enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides.

As the video progresses, it shows some more of the things I enjoyed most, which were the activities that were tailored to our program. We met with several incredible organizations and locations. First, we met with Génériques, which is an archival and academic organization that specializes in immigrants in France. We also met with Coéxister, an organization that promotes knowledge and understanding of immigrants and members of all religions in France, focusing particularly on Muslim and Jewish immigrants from the Arab world. Samia, the Coéxiter representative with whom we met, was a vibrant personality with an incredible wealth of knowledge and understanding for all peoples. Through Coéxister, we also met with young Muslim female entrepreneurs that are working in Paris, and we visited l’Institut des Cultures d’Islam, which was definitely a highlight of the trip. This building is located in the middle of a neighborhood in Paris that has a very rich immigrant population/culture, particularly from North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. The building has a functioning mosque, a Hamam (traditional bath), and many incredible art exhibitions by Muslim artists. We also visited l’Institut du Monde Arabe, a museum that shows incredible aspects of Arab culture, focusing mostly on culture before immigration to France. We visited their current exhibit on “oriental gardens,” which was artistically mesmerizing. The next day, our tour guide, Zwina, walked us around the old Arab quarter of Paris. We also visited the Porte Dorée immigrant museum of Paris. Though we found several errors and biases in the museum’s presentations, it was an excellent opportunity to learn and interact with historical media.

We did many more things than what I show in the video, including visiting IES Paris’s Center, which was just a short walk away from our hotel. The staff at IES Paris were incredibly welcoming and full of wisdom.

The other students and I also explored Paris on our own and had many adventures. Some of them are shown in the video, such as our visits to the very fun and hip areas we learned about, Canal St. Martin and the Marais. We had los of good food and saw lots of great places, but I will say I spent more on necessities (food, transportation, meds, etc.) in this one week in Paris than I had spent my entire three and a half weeks in Rabat. Paris is EXPENSIVE! I am very happy to be back in Rabat, not only because prices are more reasonable, but because I missed my host family and the city.""

Arguably the coolest and most unique part of The European Union Program is the immense amount of traveling you get to do with this amazing group of people allowing you to learn so much in the places you're studying while also getting so close to new friends.

Last week we visited the homes of several European Union institutions, reinforcing all we've been learning in our EU Integrative Seminars back in Freiburg. In Luxembourg we visited the Court of Justice and European Investment Bank. Brussels houses most of the institutions including, the Commission, Council, and more. We had several class-specific meetings in Brussels as well. Paris was more of a bonus because in addition to visiting the European office for the International Monetary Fund, we had about a day and a half of free time.

Video Transcript:

Our Christmas Vacation in Paris

Kristina: (laughs) Woohoo! Your face! You’re trying so hard!

Cody: Oops! Some people! It’s stopping.

Kristina: No, it’s not stopping! Faster! Faster!

Kristina: We’re at Galeries Lafayette and we waited over an hour to see the sunset with the Eiffel Tower. It looks kind of far in the video but it’s much closer in person. We plan to go eat in the Eiffel Tower tomorrow, so I’m very excited. You wanna tell us what we’re doing? We’re putting our lock on with all the other locks. (laughs) You can’t get it on there? There’s ours!

Kristina: Guess where we are? C’est tres belle!

December 29, 2015. 5:30am.

Kristina: Why are we here?

Cody: (grunts)

Kristina: The fire alarm went off at 5:30 a.m. this morning so everyone is standing outside the hotel in their pajamas in Paris. And the breakfast guy wants to deliver his food but can’t.

The fire alarm went off two more times that morning…

6300,Grand Paris Express – Où en sont les chantiers de la ligne 15 Sud ? (Partie 1 - Parigo Le Blog),/watch?v=G6Y-eZfBF5Q,travel blog,"On le sait depuis plusieurs mois maintenant : la ligne 15 sud du Grand Paris Express, entre Pont de -Sèvres et Noisy-Champs, ne sera pas mise en service pour les JO de 2024, alors même qu’elle devait être la toute première opérationnelle. La faute notamment à une série de difficultés techniques, dont la principale en gare de Saint-Maur, la plus profonde de France (chantier à découvrir dans une prochaine vidéo).

Pour autant, les opérateurs du BTP ne chôment pas sur ce tronçon de 33 km et 16 gares, avec un objectif : une mise en service mi-2025. Les sites en travaux sont innombrables : la plupart ont débuté en 2017 et les chantiers avancent à un rythme soutenu, parfois même 24h/24 : un an et demi après notre dernier passage, les choses ont bien changé !

Focus sur trois gares emblématiques : Bagneux, Arcueil Cachan et Villejuif Gustave Roussy, là où vont se croiser à 40 m sous terre les lignes 14 et 15. Du grand art. Vous découvrirez également un tunnelier en phase de montage, à ciel ouvert, à quelques mètres du RER B.

#vlog #paris #travel

Bonjour mes amis! Since I’ll be in Paris for one week, I won’t be able to put together any of my normal style videos while I’m traveling, so I thought I’d vlog while I’m in France! I’m going to try and daily vlog and/or vlog every single day, but I won’t make any promises just in case it ends up raining the entire time I’m here (lol). This vlog is just a talk-through (exactly like my Tokyo Vlog 2016) because I’ll also be making a Paris Travel Diary once I put together all of the footage I film when I get back to California. I hope you enjoy this Paris vlog day 1 & if the vlogs do well, hopefully I’ll see you in the next one. À bientôt!  xx Audrie

// ABOUT ME //
A little bit about me - I'm a content creator on Instagram, YouTube, and on my blog at AudrieStorme.com living in Orange County, California (originally from the San Francisco Bay Area). I started posting outfit of the day (OOTD) photos on Instagram about two years ago when I was living in Dallas, Texas for work. I loved taking photos and posting on Instagram so much that I decided to expand and try out YouTube and blogging as well.

When I was living in the city, my personal style was a bit more streetwear 90's grunge, but now that I live in Southern California and closer to the ocean, my style has become a lot more cozy and comfortable with a lot of bohemian influences.

If I had to describe my fashion sense on my blog, Instagram aesthetic, and YouTube editing style now, I'd probably describe it as modern bohemian with an edge, since I tend to wear and do things that might be considered unconventional to others. I'm not sure if that is true, but since I've moved back to California, I just find that I gravitate to what is easiest and effortless for me while living near the beach where it always feels like summer.

Thank you so much for stopping by my YouTube channel and I hope that you enjoy what you'll find here! I love fashion, beauty (especially hair styling and bohemian braids), DIY projects and how to videos, making travel diaries of all the places that I'm lucky enough to visit, and sharing my (for lack of a better term) ""modern bohemian"" lifestyle. If you'd like to see more, please feel free to subscribe to my channel. Hope to see you in the comments below!

With love,

Audrie",79GINPjke1I,32417,France,2016

6321,Grand Paris Express – Où en sont les chantiers de la ligne 16 ? (Parigo Le Blog),/watch?v=hPtFBOwgm50,travel blog,"C’est peu dire que la ligne 16 est attendue comme le messie par les 800.000 habitants qu’elle doit desservir une fois achevée. La ligne 16, c’est un chantier à 4,5 milliards d’euros, censé se terminer en 2030 avec la mise en service de son terminus Est, à Noisy-le-Grand : elle desservira alors 10 gares, sur 27,5 km. La ligne 16, c’est une nouvelle ligne de vie de 27,5 km, traversant de part en part la Seine-Saint-Denis : elle reliera notamment Saint-Denis, La Courneuve, Le Blanc-Mesnil, Aulnay-sous-Bois, Sevran et Clichy-Montfermeil, soit six communes parmi les plus pauvres d’Ile de France. La ligne 16, c’est aussi, pour sa partie la plus à l’Ouest, entre Saint-Denis et Aulnay, l’un des rares tronçons jugés prioritaires, à l’aune des Jeux Olympiques et de l’urgence de désenclaver des certains quartiers aujourd’hui coupés du monde ou presque.
Alors où est ce chantier ? Nous nous sommes rendus en gare de Saint-Denis Pleyel, La Courneuve Six routes et sur le site d’entonnement, en amont de la gare du Bourget RER : c’est là que se sépareront, à 20 m sous terre, les lignes 16 et 17.
En fin de vidéo, Thierry Dallard, président du directoire de la Société du Grand Paris, répondra à nos questions, huit mois après sa nomination et alors que se multiplient les annonces alarmistes (retards, économies etc…).

As mentioned in my previous vlog, there is a Parisian Apartment tour in this video, as well as what we did that day (saw Notre Dame, walked through the Jardin du Luxembourg, tried some French coffee & a bunch of little tidbits of what I’ll be including in my upcoming Paris travel diary.

// ABOUT ME //
A little bit about me - I'm a content creator on Instagram, YouTube, and on my blog at AudrieStorme.com living in Orange County, California (originally from the San Francisco Bay Area). I started posting outfit of the day (OOTD) photos on Instagram about two years ago when I was living in Dallas, Texas for work. I loved taking photos and posting on Instagram so much that I decided to expand and try out YouTube and blogging as well.

When I was living in the city, my personal style was a bit more streetwear 90's grunge, but now that I live in Southern California and closer to the ocean, my style has become a lot more cozy and comfortable with a lot of bohemian influences.

If I had to describe my fashion sense on my blog, Instagram aesthetic, and YouTube editing style now, I'd probably describe it as modern bohemian with an edge, since I tend to wear and do things that might be considered unconventional to others. I'm not sure if that is true, but since I've moved back to California, I just find that I gravitate to what is easiest and effortless for me while living near the beach where it always feels like summer.

Thank you so much for stopping by my YouTube channel and I hope that you enjoy what you'll find here! I love fashion, beauty (especially hair styling and bohemian braids), DIY projects and how to videos, making travel diaries of all the places that I'm lucky enough to visit, and sharing my (for lack of a better term) ""modern bohemian"" lifestyle. If you'd like to see more, please feel free to subscribe to my channel. Hope to see you in the comments below!

With love,

Raised in the United States by French parents, he focuses on legal and political theory, and was a colleague of Barack Obama's at the University of Chicago.His French background and his Chicago connection, both to the city and the University made Harcourt a perfect candidate to bring the Obama administration alive for the French, particularly since they are strong Obama supporters (polling 64 percent for Obama during the election).

I’m been dreaming of Paris since I was last here for Paris Fashion Week in 2016. I make it my business to visit this magical city every other year specifically for Fashion Week. Trust me if you’ve never been, Paris is the best of them, which is probably why it’s last! Paris Fashion Week doesn’t technically start until Tuesday Sept 25th but we arrived the weekend before to have a little fun and shoot some editorials for Fashion Steele Magazine (my yearly digital magazine that drops every year between January 1st-3rd). Make sure to check out the latest issue where we shot the cover in Marrakesh, Morocco. Here’s a look into my first two days in Paris with my friend and photographer Rose Lazard (@dadouchic) and my great friend Vanessa Lundy (@vanavain).

6367,"10 style tips from French women | ""Parisian chic"" | Justine Leconte",/watch?v=gAbV5hJzhL4,travel blog,"I often get questions about French women's style or about Parisian style. There seems to be something about it that is chic and appealing, which I only really realized once I started to travel around and live outside of France.
I asked some well-dressed French friends about their do's and dont's when putting their outfits together: they agreed on so many points!

Thumbs up if you liked this video :-)

New videos: Wednesday & Sunday.

And here is my review of Paris Fashion Week, for more French things:

6378,Indians in Dubai: Luxury & Labour Camps,/watch?v=0WE8tVlTJnw,travel blog,"Dubai is a city of extreme contract, from the luxurious living of the rich to the labour camps of the labourers. So I take you out to explore both! I'll show you how the rich live in their amazing 7-star resort-type housing developments, and then we go see how the Indian and Pakistani labours are residing in their labour camps.

We start in a luxury housing development in Dubai, United Arab Emirates which has everything you could ever want! Pools, gyms, gardens, clean, wide streets, an animal sanctuary, dog park, horse stable, mall, restaurants, supermarket, mosque and more! It's unbelievable, and I've never seen such luxury like it in my life. These people truly are living the high-life in Dubai.

Then we head out to an Indian labour camp area. These are the men who are literally building Dubai and all these housing developments we just saw. The labours in Dubai aren't living like the rich here. They live a basic life in dorm/hostel type apartments, 4 men to a room with two bunk beds for them to sleep on. These men are busy working hard to remit money back to their families in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

We spend the afternoon at the mall next to the labour camp where the labourers are hanging out and waiting for work. Most of the labourers are Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis. We drink 1 dirham (20 rs.) Masala Chai with them and get an Indian facial and head massage from a hairdresser from Meerut, India. Products and services in the labourer camp mall are very very cheap. So cheap, in fact, they're the same price as in India! I did not expect this! Dubai is known for being a costly city!

Dubai indeed is the City of Gold and nothing can beat the glitz, glamour, and money there. But it's a city of contrasts, and often the lives of poorer people are hidden. For example, I was not allowed to film inside the rooms of the labour camp as permission was needed from the Labour Camp supervisor. The workers were too scared to simply show me inside their room without his consent, lest they get in trouble, lose their job, and get deported.

In this video, you'll see the lifestyle of the wealthy highly-paid highly-skilled Indians and the lifestyle of the poorer lowly-paid lowly-skilled Indians. It's quite a contrast!

6389,"The Ultimate DUBAI FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Emirati Cuisine in Dubai, UAE!",/watch?v=rOAbYFdNQEo,travel blog,"Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!
Peyman’s Channel► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2SDLtoqPZlZYgbyMI5c2A
Subscribe for 2 new videos per week► http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2SDLtoqPZlZYgbyMI5c2A). He’s from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman’s home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it’s a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it’s a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that’s traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it’s awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman’s house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

6407,VLOG | Descubriendo Dubai en una semana,/watch?v=i_M5BzdWskw,travel blog,"Viaje a Dubai - Septiembre 2017

Primer vlog del canal y que mejor que estrenarnos con un viaje a Dubai.
Un viaje a la ciudad de los lujos y los récord Guinness, una ciudad dónde los retos son desafiados y todo lo imaginable es posible.

En nuestro viaje nos hemos hospedado en un hotel perfecto con vistas al skyline de Dubai, nos hemos perdido en busca de Jumeirah Beach, hemos cogido el metro y el bus, hemos observado la ciudad desde el edificio más alto del mundo, hemos visitado el centro comercial más grande del mundo el cual alberga un Aquarium de grandes dimensiones dentro, hemos visitado la ciudad de Abu Dhabi y la preciosa mezquita Sheikh Zayed. Nos hemos bañado en el mar índico, hemos visitado el Hotel Atlantis y su famoso Aquarium Lost Chambers y hemos pasado un día de lujo en su parque acuático Aquadventure Park. También hemos pisado el desierto Al Ain y hemos presenciado su rojizo atardecer y hemos montado a camello. Y cómo no hemos cruzado el rió Creek en uno de sus tradicionales Abras y hemos visitado la parte menos conocida de Dubai junto a sus zocos.

6432,Dubai Travel Vlog | Owlipop Blog,/watch?v=DpdfImCyDvk,travel blog,"Today I'm sharing with you our Dubai Travel Vlog from last week. We spent 7 days visiting Dubai & Abu Dhabi going on a desert Safari, visiting the Sheik Zayed Grand Mosque and of course, Burj Khalifa and Burj al Arab. I love looking back on these kind of vlogs. More infos and a Dubai travel guide will be on my blog: http://owlipop.com/blog/en/

6433,14 DO'S & DON'TS IN DUBAI 2018 BLOG POST,/watch?v=yIECYC0znQE,travel blog,"So we've all heard the horror stories of people being jailed for all sorts of things in Dubai (caught with marijuana, drunk in public, pre-marital sex, blah blah blah). In this blog post, you'll find a list of the top 14 Do's & Don'ts in Dubai 2018! Also, the activities that I did on my trip and what you should avoid in order to make your vacation memorable, and not land you in any mess. The thing that you have to keep in mind about visiting other countries is that culturally it might be very different from what you're accustomed to.

For example, in the United States, folks bounce checks all the time and get hit with that $30.00 NSF fee (no biggie), in Dubai, it's against the law to write a bad check, and it can land you in Jail. In some US, and European cities such as Amsterdam, pot use is entirely legal, marijuana law in Dubai is strict! In Dubai it's illegal!!! So keep in mind that any place that you want to visit, always research and have an understanding of their culture, beliefs, customs, and legal system. If you do this, you'll always be okay!

Momo has become a traditional delicacy in Nepal, Tibet and among Nepalese/Tibetan communities in Bhutan, as well as people of Sikkim state and Darjeeling district of India. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Nepal. Momos have also spread to other countries like United States (some parts), UK and India. Momo used to be particularly part of cultural and traditional cuisine among the Newar community specially among Tuladhar and their related clans. Till mid 90s or some years after the Jana Andolan, Momo was a popular cuisine among Newars and other communities of Nepal.

UAE's first ever, dedicated Momos (Dimsums) joint which started steaming in October 2012 and is getting more fans everyday. You will no longer miss your favorite Momos in Dubai.

We bet, you will feel to share your happiness with friends once you are done eating our delightful food at Yalla Momos.

This blog goes out to all the burger lovers who relish on beef burgers. Recently my wife and I had gone to this restaurant in Dubai mall called the Tribes a African restaurant which serves authentic African food. What's so interesting about this entire place is that it takes you back into Africa with the ambiance and decor designed to perfection. On a lighter note if you happen to be in Dubai or come to Dubai on a visit you have to visit this restaurant called tribes and trust me you don't have to fly thousand of miles to Africa. Yes I do agree being inside Africa is a beautiful and charming experience by itself which I totally agree.

So coming back to the food of the restaurant called Tribes its simply delicious. I had ordered for the Fully loaded Burger which was indeed very delicious and juice. In the past I have eaten many burgers with different brands associated to it but this burger definitely stands out as one of the best African Burgers till date.

6497,Summer in Spain: a dream adventure (travel video),/watch?v=Nl_f4bQfUoQ,travel blog,"The Ultimate Spain Travel Video: Follow a young couple around the beaches of San Sebastian, Barcelona, Ibiza and beyond. Discover what makes Spain one of the most beautiful countries on earth.

https://www.instagram.com/evanthomas.me/
https://www.instagram.com/jjuliarosen/

This Spain travel video is a semi-fictional short inspired by edits from Brandon Li, Sam Kolder and Taylor Cut Films, among others.

This Spain travel video is about a guy that meets a girl on a beach in San Sebastian. They travel together across Spain, before realizing they both have separate lives. One of my favorite movies of all time inspired this Spain travel video: ""Before Sunrise""

I originally wanted to make a Sam Kolder inspired edit, but decided half way through filming to pursue my own style. I admire the Brandon Li's editing and was inspired by his travel videos.

I hope you enjoy my Spain travel video.

On Day 21 of our Round The World Trip for food with Star Alliance, we spent the day in Barcelona. Barcelona is an amazing food city, and one of the best places to start eating is at La Boqueria. After eating and wandering, we headed over to Sagrada Família for a breathtaking tour. It was an amazing day of food and attractions in Barcelona.

00:34 Breakfast at Cotton House Hotel - We started off the morning at our hotel by having a quick breakfast. The jamon and selection of cured meats was the highlight.

2:53 Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria - Often known in short just as La Boqueria, this historical market is a food lover's paradise and a pilgrimage destination. We arrived early in the morning and headed first to Bar Pinotxo to eat our second breakfast. I ordered an omelet with eggplant and a plate of garbanzo beans and blood sausage. The dish was simple, but it was incredibly delicious. Additionally, the coffee was extremely good. Total price - 12.80 EUR ($14.04)

6:59 El Quim De La Boqueria - After finishing with the first place of tapas, I wandered over to another legendary tapas bar within La Boqueria market known as El Quim De La Boqueria. It’s a very expensive place, but I knew I wanted to try the fried eggs with baby squid. The dish was a simple combination of ingredients, but it was cooked perfectly, and it was incredibly delicious. I also couldn’t resist a plate of fried chilies. Total price - 32.05 EUR  ($35.16) There are dozens of things to eat and try at La Boqueria, and after all the salty food I was ready to have a passion fruit juice. And then finally, to conclude the Barcelona food tour of La Boqueria, I bought a cone of sliced Jamón Ibérico.

14:14 Gothic Quarter, Barcelona Cathedral - After an amazing food tour, we walked around the Christopher Columbus monument and then continued on walking around the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The Barcelona Cathedral was originally closed when we arrived, but I came back in a few minutes and walked around the Barcelona Cathedral as well.

16:37 Xarcutería La Pineda - Located just around the corner from the Barcelona Cathedral, I headed over to a place called Xarcutería La Pineda (recommended by Chris English), to try the botifarra blanca and a cup of vermouth. It’s an amazing little family run shop with a fantastic array of meats and drinks. Total price - 11.50 EUR

21:25 Basílica de la Sagrada Família - One of the most famous attractions in Barcelona is the Sagrada Familia, a basilica that was famous designed by Antoni Gaudi. I had read and dreamed about visiting for many years, so I was very excited to finally have the chance to visit. What amazed me is how dark and gothic it looks from the outside, yet how light and happy it is on the inside. Sagrada Familia is truly a stunning architectural feat, and an attraction you must visit in Barcelona. Along with visiting the main part of Sagrada Familia, I also bought tickets to go to the Nativity Tower. Going to the top of the tower and walking down was the highlight of visiting. Price - 29.00 EUR per person w/ tower entrance

26:16 Catalan Food for dinner at Restaurant Portolés - For dinner Ying and I walked over to Restaurant Portolés, a local Catalan food restaurant. Some of the main dishes I ordered included Fideuà and Rollitos De Pollo, all of which were delicious. It’s a great restaurant to try in Barcelona. Total price - 26.50 EUR

This was a fantastic day in Barcelona, packed with delicious food and attractions in Barcelona.

Castles, Mosques, Churches, Tapas, Mountains, Beaches, and Sunsets…

My first month in Spain was filled with meeting wonderful
local people, traveling to historical cities, and connecting with a lifestyle that is so different from what I've experienced so far. As a South Asian student studying in the United States, I find the Spanish culture to be a beautiful mix of the Arabic, Asian and American worlds. This video is about the travels that I've done so far in Spain as I aim to share a glimpse of what this country has in store for anyone who wishes to come here.  Each part of Spain is unique, from the Islamic and Gothic architecture to the ever-changing weather, reflecting the genuine people and the breathtaking scenery in the country. The mixture of hot and cold
weather in the Spanish landscape can take you from a mountain to a beach in a matter of minutes (sometimes seconds).

So far, I have traveled to smaller and more-preserved cities
like Segovia, Granada, Cordoba, and Toledo. Going to these cities has helped shape a better understanding of what Spain was and what Spain is; these cities are a sophisticated amalgamation of modern and medieval times. I will be traveling more around Madrid and will soon be visiting bigger cities like Barcelona to get a better picture of what life is like in the two biggest cities in Spain. Hasta pronto!""

10 Things to do in Valencia, Spain Travel Guide Video Transcript: (València)

Continuing our travels through Spain, our next stop was Valencia.

Located along the coast, Spain’s third-largest city is renowned for its mild climate, futuristic constructions and paella.

We’ll spent most of our time in Valencia was mostly spent eating, but when we weren’t restaurant hopping or snacking our way through markets, we were exploring the city on foot and the destination quickly rose to the top.

In this Valencia travel guide we’re going to take you guys on a tour of the city and show you some of the things you can do on your visit.

After lunch we were ready to go sightseeing around Valencia. Our first stop: the Silk Exchange.

We went on a walk around the Old Quarter without much of a plan in mind. We saw some street art browsed through a few shops, and randomly stumbled across the narrowest building in Europe - that’s the terracotta.

Since the tower was closed, we decided to stop by Horchateria Santa Catalina to try a drink that you either love or hate: horchata.
This cold milky-looking drink is made with chufas, better known as tiger nuts in English.

Our next attraction was Valencia Cathedral, which is home to a Holy Chalice that has been defended as the true Holy Grail.

If there’s one dish that we had to try in Valencia, it was paella. Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but Spaniards will tell you this is a regional Valencian dish.

The City of Arts and Sciences, is a cultural and architectural complex that looks quite spacey and futuristic.

The complex itself is made up of various structures including a domed-glass garden that’s filled with palm trees, the planetarium, an interactive science museum, an aquarium, an opera house, and a plaza designed to hold concerts and sporting events and Turia Park.

But paella wasn’t all we had at the restaurant. We also ordered fideuá.

We had a food adventure in Valencia’s Central Market. Although this is primarily a place to buy your fresh fish, vegetables, meat, and fruit, you can also find some stands that sell smaller snacks and traditional Spanish dishes.

To wrap up our trip to Valencia, we’ll leave you with a few nighttime shots of the city washed aglow. We hope you enjoyed this Valencia travel guide and that it gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city.

This is part of our Travel in Spain video series showcasing Spanish food, Spanish culture and Spanish cuisine.

10 Things to do in Madrid, Spain Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Greetings from Madrid, Spain. Hello hello. And this is a city we visited 2.5 years ago in the summer. We're back with my parents this time and we're going to be here for just a few days making a little travel guide and we hope you guys will join along. This one is going to be a little bit different because last time we were in Madrid we ran around like crazy. We're going to take it easy focus on the highlights. Focus on food. Delicious Spanish food. We hope you guys will enjoy our little tour of Madrid.

The armoury turned out to be a real highlight with weapons and armour dating back from the 16th and 17th centuries.

We caught a glimpse at the Almudena Cathedral and continued towards the Sabatini Gardens, which are located directly behind the palace.

After lunch, we visited the Temple of Debod. This is ancient Egyptian temple that was given to Spain as a sign of gratitude for their help in saving the Abu Simbel temples. It dates back to the 2nd century BC and it’s one of the few works of ancient Egyptian architecture that can be seen outside of Egypt.

Plaza Mayor is the main square in Madrid. It is lined with shops and cafes under its porticoes. It was just a skip over to one of the most popular food markets with visitors.

Buen Retiro is a large park located at the edge of the city centre. It belonged to the Spanish Monarchy until the late 19th century, when it became a public park, and it’s home to various gardens, sculptures, monuments and small palaces

One of the most iconic buildings found within the park is the Crystal Palace, made of glass and iron, which is used for art exhibits throughout the year.

This cafe will make you feel like you’ve been transported back to the late nineteenth century. The walls are covered in mirrors and wood panelling, the tables are of white marble, the chairs and banquettes are deep green in colour.

Last but not least, we finished off our visit with an evening stroll through Madrid, and that pretty much wraps our trip! The city clearly has much more to offer than we were able to cover in just 3 days, but we hope this Madrid travel guide gave you a few ideas of what you can do with a short break in the city. Wishing you happy travels and we’ll see you in the next video as we continue our travels through Spain!

This is part of our Travel in Spain video series showcasing Spanish food, Spanish culture and Spanish cuisine.

25 Things to do in Barcelona, Spain | Top Attractions Travel Guide Video Transcript:

This week we are exploring another Spanish city. We are in Barcelona and this video is going to highlight 25 things to do here.

It is kind of hard to believe our time in Barcelona has expired. So final thoughts.

Well, it was a really fun city to visit. Great architecture, really nice beaches. It is very lively especially at night. The only downfall is that we were here in the middle of summer so it was super hot and super crowded and sometimes that made it a little bit difficult to enjoy. Especially at midday or in the mid-afternoon. So keep that in mind. Maybe consider visiting in the springtime, fall, winter.

Well, so what did you think of the city?

It is definitely a fun city. We had a lot of fun going to the beaches. One thing that is really different about this city compared to some other European cities though is that it is really spread out. In order for us to visit all of these different attractions we had to chunk them together into groups to visit them day by day. Overall, it was a decent city. It didn't quite click with me the same way that Madrid did. But that is just personal preference I suppose.

And that is a wrap for Barcelona! Our 5 days in the city flew by, and while this guide didn't cover everything, we hope we were able to give you a feel of what this fun seaside city has to offer. As always, if you have any suggestions of things to do around town, feel free to add them in the comments below. And if you want to catch our latest travel videos, don't forget to hit subscribe!

This is part of our Travel in Spain series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Spanish culture, Spanish arts, Spanish foods, Spanish religion, Spanish cuisine and Spanish people.

This is part of our Travel in Catalonia series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Catalan culture, Catalan arts, Catalan foods, Catalan religion, Catalan cuisine and Catalan people.

Visit Spain Travel Guide | Best things to do in Spain Transcript:

So hey guys, this week we are in Costa Brava, Spain and we're going to be taking you on a bit of a food adventure. Can't wait to eat and travel.

So it is a beautiful day out. We have blue skies and I think that calls for a sailing trip.

Hi! Good morning. Ready to go sailing?

ola y bienvenidos a Madrid. This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city.

We were beyond excited to come and visit Madrid, after all this is a city renowned for its arts, cuisine, and nightlife.

With 10 days to spare, we decided to hit up some of the best sights and attractions and film a guide highlighting ""25 things to do in Madrid"".

In this video you can expect everything from lively markets and world renowned museums, to beautiful gardens and Spanish dishes.

Now let's find out what the Spanish capital is all about!

This week we are exploring another Spanish city. We are in Barcelona and this video is going to highlight 25 things to do here.

Barcelona! After a few days in the Spanish capital, we headed over to Catalunya to see what this popular seaside city has to offer. We ended up discovering an eclectic mix of funky architecture, distinct neighbourhoods, and stretches of golden beaches. It was vibrant, it was stylish, and it was addicting. Here's a look at what we got up to during our visit to this world class city:

It wouldn't be a proper visit to Barcelona without going to the beach at least once, so first things first, we headed down to Barceloneta Beach, which is popular with locals and travelers who don't want to trek out too far in search of waves and sandy shores. The sun was out, the water was inviting, and the beach was packed.

So today is July 23rd. Which means it is my birthday! So Sam and I are going to take a little day trip. We've been staying in Madrid but Toledo is only thirty minutes away by train. So we're going to head out and have some birthday adventures in a new city.

Subscribe to our channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=greenjek
It has an exact antipodal city: Auckland, New Zealand.

This small town is located 157 kilometres (98 miles) northeast of Cádiz. It has a distinctive setting along a narrow river gorge. The town extends along the course of the Rio Trejo with some houses being built into the rock walls of the gorge itself, created by enlarging natural caves or overhangs and adding an external wall.

Setenil has a reputation for its meat products, particularly chorizo sausage and cerdo (pork) from pigs bred in the surrounding hills. As well as meat, it has a reputation for producing fine pasteles (pastries), and its bars and restaurants are among the best in the region. Its outlying farms also provide Ronda and other local towns with much of their fruit and vegetables.

Singapore is known to be tiny, modern, and insanely expensive—especially next to her Southeast Asian counterparts. While $50 USD is more than enough for travellers to live like a prince in nearby countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, the same amount is barely enough for a hotel room in Singapore.

Still, with street food even Gordon Ramsay raved about, impeccably safe streets, and a location that makes it ideal as a stopover hub, there's no reason to give this city-state a miss. Yes, it is possible for those travelling on a budget to enjoy Singapore, just as the locals do.

6542,SINGAPORE | TRAVEL VLOG 2017 [PART 1],/watch?v=bXngTPEHn5c,travel blog,"Kampong Glam | Haji Lane | Tai Hwa Pork Noodles | Night Safari (Click for detailed itinerary)

Detailed itinerary:

Accomodation: Airbnb near Orchard Road
There are heaps of listings and a lot of good options depending on your budget!

1) Hai Di Lao - Hot Pot Place that opens til 6am
[http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/hai-di-lao-orchard-river-valley/]

Good value for money, extremely good service and good quality food!

2) Ya Kun Kaya Toast
[http://www.yakun.com/]

We went here for breakfast. This is a chain-store so you can go to any of the many outlets they have. Extremely good value for money and very filling breakkie! Highly recommend! The Kaya balls are amazing and you have to try their egg! The locals drink the runny egg with a straw!

3) Kampong Glam - Arab Quarter, Haji Lane
[https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g294265-d317436-Reviews-Kampong_Glam-Singapore.html#review_445046259]

A very special area in SG with a lot of cultural heritage! This place is definitely worth the visit especially with all the buildings and architecture. As I said in the vlog, you can definitely feel the culture even by being in the area. Be sure to also check at Haji Lane for all things hipster and stop by #Selfie Coffee. The coffee itself is pretty bad but it's all for the novelty of having your face printed on your drink!

4) Tai Hwa Pork Noodles @ Tai Hwa Eating House
[http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/hill_street_tai_hwa_pork_noodle/]

Michelin star pork noodles! I liked it but I did not love the dish. It was however a lot better the more you ate it! This place gets packed during lunch time so make sure you go during odd hours. We went at around 2pm on a weekday and as you can say, there wasn't really a wait at all!

5) Shopping around Orchard

There are heaps of shops and name brands that you can shop from in Orchard! This is basically the 5th Ave of Singapore! Make sure you present your passport when you spend more than SG$100 to claim your GST back at the airport! They will process everything at the shop itself and when you get to the airport, you will have to present all the receipts and the documents that the shops give you!

6) Night Safari
[http://www.nightsafari.com.sg/]

A must do! The night safari pretty much takes up the whole night. Be sure to pre-book your tickets online because it does get crowded! Plan your night and talk to the staff working there! Avoid the tram when you see long lines because it's not worth waiting for so long! Be sure to check out all the walking trails as well!

I've never been to a zoo at night so this was a very interesting and unique experience for me! The scale of the zoo is nothing like what you'd find at the Animal Kingdom in DisneyWorld but it was still a very enjoyable experience!

7) Pontian Wanton Noodles House (24 Hours)

Chain-store with multiple outlets. I tried finding a website but I can't seem to find anything. Great dried wanton noodles at a very affordable price! Portions are relatively small but it is so cheap that you can buy 2 bowls but still pay less than you'd normally pay for a proper meal!

8) Natureland Massage
[http://www.natureland.com.sg/]

Chain-store that opens for 24 hours as well! I noticed a lot of businessmen, especially Japanese businessmen was at this place. Massage itself was average but it was definitely a great way to wind down and relax after a long day!

6547,Singapore Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,/watch?v=P_q3BdrFsLI,travel blog,"https://www.expedia.com/Singapore.d180027.Destination-Travel-Guides

Small and heavily populated, Singapore is an easy place to explore; nothing in the city is more than an hour from the business district. Thanks to modern construction and outstanding architecture, Singapore is rapidly becoming a powerhouse trade city, but it maintains ties to its Asian roots through traditional temples and many cultural hotspots, like Little India and Kampong Glam.

Your Singapore tour must include the Botanical Gardens and Orchid Gardens, both beautiful and notable places to visit. If you’re a fan of exotic animals, stop by the Singapore Zoo and check in with its 300-plus species that take up residence there. You can also take a “bumboat” from Changi Beach to Pulau Ubin, set away from the bustling city, and delight in its quiet mangroves.

No Singapore sightseeing is complete without a visit to Marina Bay, a glowing, high-tech vision of the future, or Orchard Road, which boasts enough shopping to keep you occupied for several rainy afternoons.

Traveler Facts About Me:

* I prefer rolling luggages over backpacks

* I always bring power extension cords when I travel.

* I always have problems sticking to my budget when I’m traveling.

* The worst thing that happened to me while traveling so far was when I was held by the immigration officers in Paris. I made a mistake in my visa application and I actually overstayed in France. But all is well, they did let me go. And they were very nice to me.",UFSYaj4rVwI,97248,Philippines,2017

SINGAPORE  T R I P

Singapore, an island city-state off southern Malaysia, is a global financial center with a tropical climate and multicultural population. Its colonial core centers on the Padang, a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by grand buildings such as City Hall, with its 18 Corinthian columns. In Singapore's circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, said to house one of Buddha's teeth.

Hi guys!

Finally! Here’s part 1 of our Singapore Travel Vlog :)

For those of you who don’t know, me, Kyuho and his parents decided to do something a little different this year and travel abroad to spend the Chuseok holiday ^^

A huge THANK YOU to ‘Swissotel Merchant Court Singapore’, who very generously provided us with incredible accommodations during our stay. (Just to be clear, we were not paid, nor were we given any instructions regarding how to film or what to say, etc.)

→ http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/singapore-merchant-court/

→ Places that appear in this video: Clark Quay, Merlion Park, Katong District, China Town, Little India, Bugis Street.

Hope you all enjoy the video! Part 2 should be next next week ;)

6607,Singapore | Marina Mandarin Executive Club | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=9FhhHe2eay8,travel blog,"When it comes to Marina Mandarin Singapore by Meritus, you definitely can't judge a book by its cover.  The outside of the building is unassuming, leaving us insanely unprepared for the jaw-dropping awe you'll experience stepping through into the beating heart of this lovely property.  If you're lucky enough to arrive during the day, you'll be greeted by songbirds whose tunes echo throughout the hotel because all 21 floors open onto an immense atrium.  The staff are friendly and charmingly dressed, the rooms are large, and if you couldn't imagine staying in Singapore and not having the best view ... well, you're in luck because Club Rooms like mine come with a balcony and that iconic view of Marina Bay.

Why You'll Love Marina Mandarin Singapore:
-- Dim Sum Lunch at Peach Blossoms - the restaurant serves up some of the most diverse and inventive dim sum dishes that I've seen in Singapore.  There's a set all-inclusive menu and an à la carte menu with some really interesting extras like lobster and foie.  OHHH and my favourite part is that they serve bottles of Champagne and have a fab list of sakes and wines, which is not common at most dim sum lunch hotspots.
-- The Views!  Come on, we all want that stunning skyline view of Singapore and Mandarin Orchard has the best view of Marina Bay Sands and the areas around it, including the ferris wheel.  Just wait 'til you see it at night.
-- Meritus Club Lounge - I've been a huge fan of Meritus Club since I first stayed at Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort on Langkawi last year but Marina Mandarin really stands out.  They basically won my heart by serving Moët & Chandon champagne and some of the most interesting cheeses during the Club's happy hour!

6610,THE BEST FREE SPOTS IN KUALA LUMPUR · BUDGET SIGHTSEEING DAY | TRAVEL VLOG #47,/watch?v=hqpqpaDxHCA,travel blog,"We've left Chiang Mai after nearly 6 months, and now we have two days in Kuala Lumpur before we head to Sri Lanka. But what are the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur? We went on a mission to find the best free spots in Kuala Lumpur, and we had an awesome first day in the Malaysian capital.

We went to the Pavillion Mall, walked on the free KLCC - Bukit Bintang Walkway, walked around in the KLCC and took way too many pictures of the beautiful Petronas Towers before we headed to my favourite attraction of the day: The KL Forest Eco Park.

After that, we went to the famous Petaling Street in Chinatown, and from there we walked around and saw some of the most stunning buildings the city has to offer.

Have you ever been to Kuala Lumpur? And what is your favourite spot?

Hi there! I'm Anne-Li – Danish girl, globetrotter, travel vlogger, blogger and digital nomad traveling the world with my partner in crime and long-term boyfriend Mathias. Spending a month in Budapest every summer taught us that traveling does not have to be expensive and that slow travel is the way to go – for us. We have been traveling full-time since September 2016, and we usually base ourselves in one place for at least a month or two. This way of traveling is not only budget friendly – it also means that we can take our time and really explore and enjoy the place we're in. We eat local food, shop at local markets, meet local people and enjoy experiencing different cultures – all the while seeking out the best wifi and exploring everything there is to explore. Everyday is another adventure, and we’d love for you to be part of it!

6611,Best Things to do in Kuala Lumpur - Overnight City Guide,/watch?v=WzyXTUrcLaw,travel blog,"Overnight is a travel and food show for today’s traveler and we’ve been working on this web series for 4 months now. In today’s time hungry world, people want to try and experience so much in so little time. In fact, we discovered that most people travelling around Asia would spend on average 36 to 72 hours in any given capital city. So we decided to the same thing. Overnight will go through 5 large Asian cities (Taipei, Saigon, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Seoul) and will attempt to show you what you can do during those precious few hours you have in the metropolis. From drinking, eating, discovering new cultures all the way up to clubbing. Overnight’s got you covered.

Here is your Kuala Lumpur City Guide!

#ThingsToDo #KualaLumpur #TravelokaTravelGuide


It doesn’t matter whether you’ve lived in Kuala Lumpur your entire life, become a naturalized KLite or visited the city often enough that you think you’ve tried everything – there’s always something new cropping up in this dynamic capital.

In our newest video series, “Traveloka Travel Guide” we’ll be covering the top things to see and do – and eat! – In various destinations across Malaysia that aren’t exactly mainstream. Our first stop is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s crowning jewel. So if you’re stuck on what to do in Kuala Lumpur, then today’s your lucky day.

Usually, when an individual mentions Kuala Lumpur, you think of the Menara KL Tower and Petronas Towers. This time round though, we’re looking to explore equally awesome places to visit in Kuala Lumpur that not everyone may know about.

1) KL Bird Park (0:50-2:21)
First up is KL Bird Park. Known as the “World’s Largest Free-flight Walk-in Aviary” and home to more than 200 species of local and foreign birds, this is a Kuala Lumpur attraction you don’t want to miss.

2) Hornbill Restaurant & Café (2:22-3:05)
Stop by the Hornbill Restaurant & Café while you’re in KL Bird Park to chow down on some delicious food and fulfil your appetite from all that walking.

3) Perdana Botanical Garden (3:06-4:51)
Another great place to visit in Kuala Lumpur is the Perdana Botanical Garden. Besides being a gorgeous park, it also has a deer park, a couple of playgrounds and bicycles you can rent. If you feel like it, you could bring your own equipment and play a little frisbee or football with your pals. The best part about this place is that it’s free!

4) Restoran Rebung By Dato Chef Ismail (4:52-6:59)
Right next to the Perdana Botanical Garden is Restoran Rebung By Dato Chef Ismail, so if you’re yearning for some top-notch traditional Malay cuisine buffet to fill your belly, stop by the restaurant and give it a try. With awesome dishes like Ikan Bakar (grilled fish), Rendang Ayam (chicken rendang) and Asam Pedas Ikan Pari (spicy stingray), you’ll probably want to return to the Perdana Botanical Garden to burn some calories. The lunch buffet is priced at RM40.00 while the dinner buffet is priced at RM50.00.

5) River of Life (7:00-7:59)
Next up on our Kuala Lumpur sightseeing trip is the River of Life. Once a polluted waterway, it is now a tourist attraction. While nice to visit in the day, the junction where the rivers meet at the city’s oldest mosque, Masjid Jamek Sultan Abdul Samad, is best seen at night. During the night, the riverside becomes a magical place filled with breathtaking visuals and sensory experience with fog and lighting effects.

6) The Hulo Hotel & Gallery (8:00-10:02)
Catch some shut-eye at The Hulo Hotel & Gallery, where you’ll be surrounded by beautiful works of art created by Malaysian artists to showcase their work. Located in Bukit Bintang, you can easily reach other popular Kuala Lumpur attractions such as Berjaya Times Square and Bintang Walk, KL’s premier shopping district. Rates for the Premium King Room is RM200- 220.

7) myBatik (10:04-11:53)
Attempt to master the intricate traditional art of batik painting with myBatik, one of Kuala Lumpur’s top cultural hubs. Interested visitors can sign up for various batik painting workshops. Price for Batik Colouring & Waxing is RM53 while the price for T-shirt Painting Workshop is RM127.

8) That Latte Place (11:55-13:11)
Relax and enjoy a cup of hot latte (RM9) at this hidden gem just off Jalan Ampang. If you’re feeling a bit peckish, try their Croque Chicken Sandwich (RM13), Breakfast Plate (RM18) or Turkish-style Poached Eggs (RM12).

9) Aquaria KLCC (13:12-15:13)
This Kuala Lumpur attraction is home to over 150 species of marine life. There are 12 exhibits for you to learn more about the wonders of our oceans. To witness sharks being fed, be at the Aquatheatre by 3pm on Mondays, Wednesdays or Saturdays. Price of admission for visitors with MyKad is RM49 for adults, RM 39 for children and RM39 for senior citizens. Price for standard admission is RM69 for adults, RM59 for children and RM49 for senior citizens.

10) Tapak Urban Street Dining (15:14-17:25)
Tapak Urban Street Dining is a KL food truck park serving many types of savoury snacks and dishes from 6pm to 12am. From local and fusion to Mexican and Western food, they have it all. Prices are reasonable with food like Pad Krapow Daging and Salted Egg Chicken selling for RM8 and RM10 respectively.",SNvHPlIMdI4,306216,Malaysia,2018

6622,FIRST TIME IN MALAYSIA - 1 Month in Kuala Lumpur,/watch?v=JanmDpj6D5o,travel blog,"Our first time in Malaysia is incredible so far! We are spending 1 month in Kuala Lumpur and had no idea we would fall in love with Malaysia this quickly. This is our first day exploring, so we did a small Kuala Lumpur city tour where we take you to Masjid Jamek, KL Chinatown or Petaling Street and Central Market.

First stop for these two Americans in Malaysia was Kuala Lumpur’s massive Chinatown, also known as Petaling Street. We shopped around some Chinatown clothing and food stalls to start soaking in a real Malaysia experience. We were lucky to have a local Malaysian transplant, Sherry, to help us find the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.

Next up we headed into the Kuala Lumpur Central Market for an even bigger dose of shopping. We discovered that the history of the Kuala Lumpur Central market dates back over 100 years and started as the KL’s largest wet market. So far, it’s been a great way to spend our first day in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia!

Last but certainly not least, we flew the drone and soaked in the fantastic scenery of Masjid Jamek which is the oldest Mosque in Kuala Lumpur. Masjid Jamek should be on every list for what to do in Kuala Lumpur, as it’s natural beauty set between two rivers is breathtaking. Approaching Masjid Jamek, we were even more inspired to make this Malaysia vlog an epic one with some risky drone shots and an extended Broll section all of you DBV Fam have come to know and love.

We couldn’t have asked for a better experience for our first time in Malaysia and are so happy we are deciding to spend 1 month in Kuala Lumpur! Be on the lookout for the next Kuala Lumpur Vlog, as we will be in KL for 1 month and then an island in Malaysia for another month. Overall, we are spending two months in Malaysia and can’t wait to share every moment with you guys. Subscribe if you haven’t already and leave a comment, we will write back to you shortly!

6623,3 Amazing Days in Kuala Lumpur 2019 | TRAVEL VLOG 24,/watch?v=FIJJzZl6rOE,travel blog,"Hello Everyone!

We started out our 2019 New Years right with a celebration in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We had 3 full days in this city which was the perfect amount of time to go sightseeing, eat delicious food, and relax by the pool.

This city was a very nice change from the hustle bustle in Ho Chi Minh as we found KL to be more spread out with more accessibility in regards to walking around the city. There was also much more greenery than we expected.

We hope you enjoy our video!

ABOUT US
Hi, we’re Chris and Mandy, travel bloggers and creators from Australia. Since December 2015, we have been travelling and exploring the world full-time. We usually spend 1-2 months in each place we travel to and love really getting to know a place. One of our favourite ways to get to know a destination is through food, and we share all of our food guides here on Youtube and on our travel blogs. We love to pack light, travelling the past 3 years with carry-on only. On AlmostLanding.com, we share in-depth guides to help you plan the best trip, we often have free printable guides you can download or print out, we’ve created our own travel maps pinpointing our favourite picks for different places so you can easily find everything and make travel planning easy. We have another travel blog all on Bali, AlmostLanding-Bali.com, we’ve spent so much time in Bali and share everything we know and love about this beautiful island. We’ve fallen in love with travel and blogging, and we wanted to create a space for other travel lovers and life dreamers. Thanks for being a part of Almost Landing, and make sure to say hi :)",XCQv-H7o6X4,4663,Australia,2018

Drew also went running at Kuala Lumpur City Center and visited the oldest mosque in Kuala Lumpur, and tried the shopping at the bazaars in Little India. Drew also joined 5,000 other tourists climb up the steps to the Batu Caves.

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you’ll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It’s a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

6647,The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Staycation Spa Weekend | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=Azw7vz60zrs,travel blog,"Whether you’re looking for a spa and foodie weekend ‘staycation’ or a fabulous hotel to call home during your holiday or business trip to KL, The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur is going to be just what the doctor ordered. Located just 2 kilometres away from the iconic Petronas Towers, The Ritz is a haven of pampering for both the body and soul. Their newly renovated rooms opened only a few months ago but I swear I felt like the first guest to stay in mine (it was utterly pristine) … and with attentive butler service, I rarely wanted to leave it. Foodies will love The Ritz because you’ll find something to tempt you day or night between their five diverse restaurants and lounges, with hands-down the best jellyfish in their fine dining Cantonese restaurant Li Yen that I’ve tried in my life.

Why You’ll Love The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:
- The service! I’ve been reviewing 5-star hotels since 2011 and this is the first time I’ve listed ‘service’ as the #1 love but it’s true. It doesn’t matter where I go in the hotel, because I’ve been here a couple of times before (for afternoon tea and once for Sunday brunch) the staff not only knows what I like and brings it without asking but they all magically seem to greet me by name – I love that!
- The 1-bedroom suites are bright and modern and so absolutely perfect you'll want to stay IN on this visit to KL.
- The food!  Lordy, lordy the fooooood!  I ate so much, and so well, that I left with a couple extra kilos I'm sure.  Don't miss their afternoon tea (my #1 favourite of the big hotels so far in Kuala Lumpur) or the Menu Du Jour for dinner in The Library, it was my favourite meal of the weekend.
- Champagne 'Sunday Roast' Brunch!  It's a grown up brunch, without donuts or waffle stations, and it's scrumptious.

6650,Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=KcMxxDFX1HI,travel blog,"I knew I was in trouble when I was told that afternoon tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur featured 39 unique blends of teas – one of them only available at The Ritz in KL! Honestly, how does one decide which tea to sip when the selection is so beautifully mixed? Well, why sip just one when I could be naughty and try four? So I did. That, and indulge in an awe-inspiring selection of savoury and sweet treats that turned this High Tea into the highlight of my week!

Why You’ll Love Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:
- The food is to-die-for delicious. I don’t have a single complaint or even note from my visit, it was all perfect
- A quartet in white tuxedo jackets plays the prettiest music you can imagine – from iconic 50s love songs to popular songs playing on the radio today. Think Breakfast At Tiffany’s meets Taylor Swift. They made the ambiance perfectly magical
- Their exclusive tea blend is named ‘The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Blend’ and it is a mix of Chinese Tie Kuan Ying (tea served to royalty since the Tang dynasty) and green Oolong that is smooth and creamy, and smells of white flowers to me. I loved it!
- They serve fruit infusions for those looking to avoid the caffeine kick
- TIP for Vegetarians (or anyone with special dietary needs): You will LOVE their VIP service! Call 2 days prior to your visit and the chef will create a personalised afternoon tea menu just for you

ABOUT US
Hi, we’re Chris and Mandy, travel bloggers and creators from Australia. Since December 2015, we have been travelling and exploring the world full-time. We usually spend 1-2 months in each place we travel to and love really getting to know a place. One of our favourite ways to get to know a destination is through food, and we share all of our food guides here on Youtube and on our travel blogs. We love to pack light, travelling the past 3 years with carry-on only. On AlmostLanding.com, we share in-depth guides to help you plan the best trip, we often have free printable guides you can download or print out, we’ve created our own travel maps pinpointing our favourite picks for different places so you can easily find everything and make travel planning easy. We have another travel blog all on Bali, AlmostLanding-Bali.com, we’ve spent so much time in Bali and share everything we know and love about this beautiful island. We’ve fallen in love with travel and blogging, and we wanted to create a space for other travel lovers and life dreamers. Thanks for being a part of Almost Landing, and make sure to say hi :)",bUjFONsnuAU,11493,Australia,2018
6655,"ARRIVING IN MALAYSIA - FIRST NASI LEMAK! | Kuala Lumpur Airport Train | Travel Vlog 081, 2017",/watch?v=0Q6ey_FMW_k,travel blog,"Malaysia food and Nasi Lemak here we come! We arrive in Kuala Lumpur Airport in this travel vlog and figure out the Airport Train MRT system - it was super fast and well priced to get into town - we share the details. ⬇ Click 'Show More' to expand ⬇

After finding our accommodation we hit the streets of Kuala Lumpur to check out the Central Market for some Malaysian food, turns out the Central Market is more of a clothes shopping place, whoops. Didnt research that well.

We then stumble upon China Town, the perfect place for any shopping of fake clothes, shoes etc in 2017, but not really our vibe at the time - we wanted to try some Malaysian Food and get a Nasi Lemak!

Eventually we found a nice little spot on a typical Kuala Lumpur side street and got some Malay food. We got to taste Nasi Lemak, 2 different types actually, they were both insanely good! Can tell we're gonna love the food in Malaysia already.

We'll have about 10 Malaysian vlogs to follow this one - subscribe for loads more!

Malaysian Street Food - Malaysian Food - Kuala Lumpur Street Food
Malaysian Street Food in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is the best! A multicultural display of extremely delicious specialty food is available for eating. Within Malaysian street food, there is Malay Street food, Chinese Street Food, and Indian street food all available to try and the options are endless. Kuala Lumpur street food is some of the best in the world. Street food around the world is different everywhere, but what is so special about Malaysia is how multicultural everything is and how unique the cooking and food culture is. So for my 3rd trip to Malaysia, we came for a Kuala Lumpur food tour. Chuchu and I decided to travel to Malaysia on a 4 day eating vacation to eat as much street food and local specialties as we could.

One thing that we both fell in love with about Malaysian cuisine, is that you could really spend a lifetime eating here tasting the local varieties of Chinese food, Indian Food, and Malay Food. With our limited amount of time on this trip, we ate non stop to sample all of the Kuala Lumpur food available. That being said, in 4 days, we barely scratched the surface of Malaysian food, there is so much more!

We visited a few famous Chinese cuisine places, a few famous Malay cuisine places, and of course some amazing Indian cuisine as well.

Below are the addresses for the Malaysian cuisine that we sampled in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia:

1) Chinese Indian Food (Fish Head Curry) - PUDU CHINESE INDIAN RICE @ RESTORAN SIN HIAP KEE
2) Nasi Campur and Ikan Bakar @ Gerai Pak Lang Ikan Bakar - Kampung Baru
3) Malaysian dessert street Cendol
4) Malaysian Nasi Lemak at Village Park
5) Banana Leaf Rice at Sri Paandi in Little India (Brickfields)
6) Nasi Dagang only open on the weekends at Nasi Dagang Warung Terengganu
6) Ooi Noodle House famous Pork Noodle
7), Jalan SS 15/4b, Ss 15, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia
8)Restoran Home Cooking @ Sungai Way, PJ - near the Indian temple at Sungai Way
9) Durian at SS2 Durian Wai’s Durian
10) Dry Bak Kut Teh AKA Rougucha @ Yap Chuan Bak Kut Teh, Puchong
11) Roti Canai at Nasi Kandar Pelita

6668,"Tips travel ke Kuala Lumpur, Vlog Malaysia hari pertama / AWI WILLYANTO",/watch?v=WtbsPjoZXx8,travel blog,"Hi FRIENDS !! Gimana kabar kalian ? Akhirnya aku travel lagi dan bikin serial travel vlog kembali !! Hehhehe, kali ini Aku ke Malaysia bersama keluarga aku ( termasuk keponakan aku yang unyu - unyu, panggil saja mereka Yeye dan Coco ).

Kita ke Malaysia selama 3 hari dan 3 malam, dimulai dari Jumat siang tanggal 28 September 2018 , dan pulang di hari Senen malam tanggal 1 Oktober 2018. Jadi ngambil cuti 1 stengah hari di kantor, dan untungnya boss lagi gak rese. Jadi gampang deh ambil cutinya, hehehe !!

- Untuk harga tiket pesawat ( pesawat Lion Air, pemesanan via traveloka ), kita membayar Rp 1.000.000 untuk per orang, dewasa / anak kecil.
- Untuk penginapan di malam pertama kita menginap di : Dorsett Residences Bukit Bintang, Kuala lumpur ( googling yah untuk detailnya ), dengan biaya per malam 1,1 juta per malam ( 2 kamar tidur, 2 toilet, 1 dapur )

By the way, awalnya pengen bikin review untuk snack yang ada di 7-11 Malaysia, tapi ternyata makanannya gak terlalu beda sama yang ada di Indonesia. Keputusannya gak jadi bikin snack review deh, tapi gapapa, tetep ada biaya detail dan cerita perjalanan setiap harinya koq. Hehehhe.. FYI, untuk ke Malaysia, ini yang ke-2 kalinya dan bahasa yang mereka gunakan, mirip - mirip sama Bahasa Indonesia. Jadi tipsnya, kalau mau ajak ngobrol, pake bahasa Indonesia ajah. Kalo dia udah bingung, baru deh pake bahasa inggris. Hahahha !!

Yoweis, nonton ajah deh Video travel ke Malaysia ini. Moga membantu kalian ya kalau mau travel ke Malaysia ! Kalo ada pertanyaan, monggo dikirimkan lewat komentar / mungkin instagram / mungkin kirim email. Enjoy !


Kalo kalian mau nanya / berinteraksi langsung, ini ada Account Sosial Media Awi yang bisa kalian datengin..

Trip to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia travel diary / vlog (Day 1) Watch in 720p
Selamat Datang! (Welcome!)  Malaysia travel videos are upcoming from my 2018 trip in Kuala Lumpur.  This kl travel video sums up our first day trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 2018. Our trip in Kuala Lumpur City, Malaysia begins arriving at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang District Malaysia taking us about 4 hours from NAIA in  Manila via Malaysia Airlines. We stayed at Crown Regency Suites throughout our trip in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. Our Kuala Lumpur day tour kicks off at strolling around Suria KLCC and the famous Petronas Twin Towers. Of course, we could not possibly miss seeing the Petronas Towers in Malaysia especially we stayed only a few blocks away from this famous tourist attraction in Kuala Lumpur City. It was a dream to see the Twin towers in Malaysia with my very own eyes. As the sun sets, we ride Rapid KL train to Central Market Kuala Lumpur and from there we head to check out what Kuala Lumpur Chinatown has to offer us. This Chinese night market in Malaysia which was buzzing with busy people and a variety of products, was  where we ate our first dinner during our trip in Malaysia. This was only Day 1 but we truly experienced the joyful colors of Malaysia, can't wait to share more of our trip. Hope you enjoyed watching this Malaysia travel video diary, as much as I enjoyed filming and editing this cinematic travel montage. See you on Day 2 to 4!

Terima Kasih Berbnayak-banyak! Thank you very much!

ABOUT US
Hi, we’re Chris and Mandy, travel bloggers and creators from Australia. Since December 2015, we have been travelling and exploring the world full-time. We usually spend 1-2 months in each place we travel to and love really getting to know a place. One of our favourite ways to get to know a destination is through food, and we share all of our food guides here on Youtube and on our travel blogs. We love to pack light, travelling the past 3 years with carry-on only. On AlmostLanding.com, we share in-depth guides to help you plan the best trip, we often have free printable guides you can download or print out, we’ve created our own travel maps pinpointing our favourite picks for different places so you can easily find everything and make travel planning easy. We have another travel blog all on Bali, AlmostLanding-Bali.com, we’ve spent so much time in Bali and share everything we know and love about this beautiful island. We’ve fallen in love with travel and blogging, and we wanted to create a space for other travel lovers and life dreamers.

6680,Kuala Lumpur | Afternoon Tea at St. Regis | Malaysia Luxury Travel Food Blog,/watch?v=0YoIK-VxJx4,travel blog,"I created this video for Instagram but thought I'd share it here, too :-) When I was at afternoon tea, The Drawing Room filled up with tables of friends who looked absolutely elegantly dressed for a stroll in the gardens of le château de Versailles in  springtime.  St. Regis Kuala Lumpur is the new kid in town and they are bringing us afternoon tea in The Drawing Room with a French twist.  Both the executive chef of St. Regis KL and the pastry chef are français and it comes through in their version of high tea.

Served from 3 - 5pm daily, afternoon tea is a relatively healthy affair ... with one option to choose from (sadly no 'bubbles' package) that includes 5 different teas, 4 or 5 savoury canapé-sized sandwiches, plain or cranberry scones served with homemade jam or clotted cream, and 5 different sweet pastries.  Absolutely everything is homemade on-site and quite yummy.

So much good food in Malaysia it was incredible! Today was the first of two full days I vlogged in Malaysia. We visited the Chow Kit Food Market, where lots of delicious Street Food and Malay cooking ingredients can be found. Between eating we rested at the Face Suites in our infinity pool on the 51st floor overlooking the Petronas Twin Towers. We visited KLCC, Little India, China Town and ended the night with a Street Food Feast at Jalan Alor Night Market.

Make sure to stay tuned for the full food video I will be making about all the delicious Indian, Malaysian and Chinese Street Food we ate in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This is the first of a two part vlog series.

6690,Kuala Lumpur | The Gardens Hotel Executive Club Room & Lounge | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=7vYMCaf_4qE,travel blog,"A foodie-fabulous hotel awaits you in Kuala Lumpur high above The Gardens and (next to) Mid Valley Mall.  St. Giles The Gardens Hotel offers up breathtaking views of KL, a large executive club, and access to the single best shopping in the city!  No joke, if you're looking for a revolving door to the world's best brands and top luxury goods, this is the only hotel for you.  Ohhhhh, and their fine dining restaurant and wine bar Sage will have you singing with their perfect wine and Champagne pairings.

Why You'll Love St. Giles The Gardens:
- Sage!  OMG ... Sage was a highlight of my stay, and a culinary experience that I absolutely 100% enjoyed.  That team knows how to whip up a fine dining extravaganza that delights the senses, with the in-house almost-sommelier pairing the meal to perfect.
- Shopping, shopping, shopping!  Ohhhh lordy all the shopping!  You'll be sat above the single BEST shopping mall in KL for all things that bling and entice the consumer-senses!
- The bathrooms!  No joke, I'm being totally serious.  I'm no spring chicken and that bathroom was a gift with a well-lit vanity mirror and lots of light.  It was easy to get ready there at The Gardens.

6691,Kuala Lumpur | Enfin by James Won Kitchen Tour | Malaysia Food Blog,/watch?v=ufoZhII9nUs,travel blog,"As a foodie, of course spending an afternoon with the team was fabulously fun but, to be honest, it was a true an educational experience ... and that I did not expect.  I learned about the wonderful quality difference of using leaven instead of standard yeast in bread making (and did you know that leaven is an actual organic life form that needs caring for so it doesn't die?  It was news to me!).  I witnessed a dedication to perfection that you don't see often.

Enfin by James Won is a culinary blend of everything in modern French cuisine that we crave, mixed with a bit of local love in Kuala Lumpur.  Malaysian-born Chef James trained in Le Cordon Bleu and worked with Alain Ducasse in Paris at the 3 Michelin star restaurant in Sofitel Le Parc.  He's an ambassador for some of our favourite brands like Krug and Hennessy.  Yet it's his drive to showcase the best of Malaysia's harvests in modern French cuisine that makes him truly unique for me.

It was one of my favourite meals of the year.  And I'll confess, while the lobster, pasta, and that dessert stand out as INSANELY PERFECT for me ... it was the ice plant salad that completely won my heart.  Honestly, it was so original and so delicious, I still dream about it!  Price for 5 courses is RM448, with an additional RM235 for that awesome Krug, wine & fine cognac pairing.

Here are a couple of my favourite courses:
- Amuse bouche: Japanese caviar, sea grapes, potato and leek, paired with a cocktail by the mixologist
- Entrée (OMG that salad!!!): Ikura, ice plant, puffed quinoa, yolk in prawn oil, shrimp powder and chili, paired with Krug Grand Cuvee
- Plat principal: Japanese cod (skilfish) poached in seaweed butter, scarlet prawns, purple brassica, tomato, pickled Bentong ginger, ginger torch, lobster bisque, and half lobster tail, paired with Château Pegau, Cuvee Lone 2014
- Dessert: Beetroot, parmesan cheese mousse, raspberry, chocolate, charcoal and coconut, pandanus sponge, paired with Hennessy X.O

My good friend Teresa messaged yesterday to say that I'd better do something fabulous enough for my birthday that I could blog about it ... and it turns out I really, really did!  This is the very first birthday I'm spending in Malaysia.  Fingers crossed it is the first of many to come.  I turned 46 yesterday and had a BLAST doing it.  My new friend Maria Tunku Sabri (a celeb in Malaysia who pioneered the country's television cooking shows) had invited me to try the Crab Factory with her and a few work mates, the date it turned out was my special day, and it was perfect.  I spent hours laughing and talking about holidays, culinary adventures, and straight up FOOD with the owner T.Y., Maria, and four more of TV3s sweetest TV presenters.

Despite of this places is much more spots you have to see when in Goa..
some you can find on my other videos from India. Like my Yoga School Shiva Shakti and the most beautiful beach in Goa- Patnem Beach.

My fav places to eat is Zest Cafe, Mandala Cafe, Little Word, Magic Italy, Nirvana Cafe and the Space!  You have to discover the hidden place at Palolem beach called- Jojo/s Sundowner- watching the sunset there is the best plan, you will not forget that view! also they have amazing pizza :)


website of my yoga school:  https://www.shivashaktiyoga.org

I strongly recommend my Yoga School for everyone who wants to practice HathaYoga, get inspired and have a lifetime experience in amazing place with lovely, caring and good people!

6740,Goa Trip With Friends Vlog -3 Days in GOA | BEACHES | CHURCHES - Road Trip (2018),/watch?v=32J4Dg2mDdY,travel blog,"GOA TRAVEL BLOG - GOA BEYOND THE BEACHES!

Why is it so difficult to think of Goa beyond its beaches? Even when I were to close my eyes a month back and think of Goa I too would think of beaches - pristine blue with golden sand and perhaps a bottle of Goa's favourite chilled beer King's. However, my last trip to the land changed it all. Here is my Travel blog story on Goa beyond the beaches.

Goa beyond beaches street
Goa beyond beaches - streets of Panjim

Imagine walking through a lane in Goa with Portuguese houses all around you, and chatter in local Konkani and Portuguese filtering out of windows. The doors of these homes are open and families are happily wishing each other with cakes and hugs. If you are wondering this would be a typical day in colonial Goa in 1895, think again. The old world charm of Goa is not lost, not yet. It lives on in areas away from the overcrowded beaches, shouts of drunk men check women out and unlimited empty bottles of beer thrown around. If you have seen all of this, and want to explore something new in Goa - discover the Old Goa, discover Goa beyond beaches, alcohol and trance parties.


Goa beyond beaches: Portuguese houses
Once you walk around a little in old Goa, it's easy to get addicted to its houses, especially the ones from Portuguese era. These houses have the most beautiful colors and textures, and are very inviting as photography subjects.

A beautiful lane in Goa

The best parts for house walks and house watching are:
Panjim
Old Goa
Divar
Numerous smaller town across the state

6771,A Weekend in Goa | South Goa Travel Vlog,/watch?v=yrSNgbB-XaU,travel blog,"I was in Goa the last weekend and this is my travel vlog from there. I was staying in Caravela Beach Resort in South Goa and it is a beautiful property. I love Goa in the monsoon season - it is beautifully green. A lot of the South Goa properties have private beaches so I spent a lot of time at this private beach in Goa which was owned by hotel Caravela. It was a refreshing weekend trip! Mumbai to Goa is definitely doable on a weekend if you can take the flight or you can even drive down of you have more days / time.

Hope you enjoyed watching my travel vlog from my weekend in Goa.

6780,A Taste Of India: Ep 2 - Backpacking from Goa To Kerala,/watch?v=HTcHXMURsS4,travel blog,"Watch my first trip to India in this travel documentary, as I spent 6 weeks backpacking around the country.

I spent 3 weeks backpacking through the cities of the north and then another 3 weeks in the beaches and backwaters of the south.

Episode 2 of this travel documentary is the southern half of ny journey.

Starting in Goa I enjoyed the different beaches and vibes of north and south Goa, including Vagator, Arambol and Palolem beach.

I then travelled inland to the beautiful ancient ruins of Hampi.

Working my way further south I relax on a canoe through the stunning Kerala backwaters, before finishing my trip in the cool beach town of Varkala.

You best believe it's time for Indian food tour #5, baby. Not only is Panjim a great city to travel, but it's also a great city to EAT.

CAMERA & AUDIO EQUIPMENT I USE:
Camera: Sony RX100 M3 ► http://amzn.to/2sLZDis
Voiceover Mic: Samson Go Mic ► http://amzn.to/2sSc3FY
In-Field Mic: Zoom H1 ► http://amzn.to/2sLXovV
Tripod: Manfrotto Pixi ► http://amzn.to/2sLNrOX
EXPLANATION: I try to keep my equipment as simple as possible. 90% of the time, all I use to film is my Sony RX100 M3, and all I use for audio is my Samson Go Mic (which I use to record voiceovers after filming). Occasionally I use the Zoom H1 for audio if I want to record audio in-field. As for the Pixi tripod, I sometimes use it while filming food, but most of the time I use it to mount my Samson Go Mic on a desk for voiceovers (in conjunction with the other accessories, listed below).

MODULAR COMPONENTS I USE:
Smatree SmaPole S3 (hollow pole only) ► http://amzn.to/2sLI7ee
Joby Action Arm (arm only) ► http://amzn.to/2toE0CN
Joby Hand Grip (hand grip only) ► http://amzn.to/2sSe3y0
Joby Hub Adapter ► http://amzn.to/2toDJ2E
EXPLANATION: Because I'm often traveling, I prefer to have the lightest, smallest, most versatile components available. Therefore, I use bits and pieces from the above gear sets, and these bits and pieces can be connected together in a huge variety of ways. For example, they can be made into a long selfie stick, they can be mounted to my tripod to make it extra-tall, and they can be used with my tripod and Go Mic to position the microphone directly in front of my face while I'm recording voiceovers at a desk.

MICROPHONE ACCESSORIES I USE:
Foam Mic Cover ► http://amzn.to/2sSagRo
Pop Filter ► http://amzn.to/2sSJSHf
EXPLANATION: To improve sound quality for voiceovers, I place a mic cover on the Samson Go Mic, then use an elastic band to hang the pop filter on top. This is not the best audio protection available, but it is the most minimalistic and space-efficient gear for traveling. The mic cover can also be used on the rare occasion that I record audio with the Zoom H1.

GEAR I USE FOR CHARGING ON-THE-GO:
Anker Mini PowerBank ► http://amzn.to/2sHy8HZ
Silicone Cables ► http://amzn.to/2tgXf1i
Adapter for Micro to Mini ► http://amzn.to/2sEhlVm
Adapter for Micro to Lightning ► http://amzn.to/2sMBGbd
EXPLANATION: Anker's lipstick-sized powerbanks are small yet powerful. I travel with two, so that if one has a low charge, I can charge it in my hotel while I'm out and about with the other powerbank.

6794,Goa Tourism | Famous 10 Places to Visit in Goa Tour,/watch?v=XQwcCdKGjPQ,travel blog,"Explore the famous Goa tourist places and sightseeing spots for the best Goa tour experience.

Goa also called as the jewel of the east coast is visited by millions of tourists every year. Famous for its beaches, serene beauty and places of worship, it becomes an ideal destination for a quick getaway. The place witnesses an immense influx of people during the New Year’s time.


Top 15 Places to See in Goa
1. Agonda Beach
So if you are a nature lover do check this place out as it offers the most beautiful sights. It catches tourist attractions primarily because of the fort that stands on the cliff that faces the beach. This place is perfect to enjoy the beauty of setting sun and also offers a variety of water sports as well.
2. Palolem Beach
This beach is one of the most beautiful beaches of the city. It has a very calm sea, no rough tides and angry water. So here you can easily walk 100m into the sea and enjoy the feeling of moving water running through your feet. You can get Ayurveda Massage also while you are there.
3. Basilica of Bom Jesus
It is a central place for Catholics in Goa and the incorrupt body of St Francis is kept here. This church was made in 1605 and is one of the best examples of baroque architecture in the country.
4. Fort Aguada
Fort Aguada is a heritage from the Portuguese. This fort faces the Arabian Sea from 1612. This fort was basically made to provide defense against Dutch and Marathas. At present it stands as a landmark that divides the Sinquerium Beach and the Candolim Beach.

6798,"Benaulim Beach FEEDING FRENZY // Feeding Stray Dogs in GOA, INDIA // BUCKWILD Travel Tour",/watch?v=bib-lVlYoG4,travel blog,"► Previous India Adventure: http://bit.ly/2pcJfUd

Don't mind me, I'm just feeding some stray dogs in Benaulim Beach, Goa, India over here. VEGETARIAN dogs to be exact. Welcome to India, home of some MIGHTY fine stray dogs. If you want to see a hunger-crazed canine feeding frenzy, you've come to the right place. I mean, as you can see, these precious poochies and perfect pups were cruising around that beach like BUCKWILD watch dogs in dire need of an owner. If that doesn't strike a cord with your heart, then I don't know what will.

CAMERA & AUDIO EQUIPMENT I USE:
Camera: Sony RX100 M3 ► http://amzn.to/2sLZDis
Voiceover Mic: Samson Go Mic ► http://amzn.to/2sSc3FY
In-Field Mic: Zoom H1 ► http://amzn.to/2sLXovV
Tripod: Manfrotto Pixi ► http://amzn.to/2sLNrOX
EXPLANATION: I try to keep my equipment as simple as possible. 90% of the time, all I use to film is my Sony RX100 M3, and all I use for audio is my Samson Go Mic (which I use to record voiceovers after filming). Occasionally I use the Zoom H1 for audio if I want to record audio in-field. As for the Pixi tripod, I sometimes use it while filming food, but most of the time I use it to mount my Samson Go Mic on a desk for voiceovers (in conjunction with the other accessories, listed below).

MODULAR COMPONENTS I USE:
Smatree SmaPole S3 (hollow pole only) ► http://amzn.to/2sLI7ee
Joby Action Arm (arm only) ► http://amzn.to/2toE0CN
Joby Hand Grip (hand grip only) ► http://amzn.to/2sSe3y0
Joby Hub Adapter ► http://amzn.to/2toDJ2E
EXPLANATION: Because I'm often traveling, I prefer to have the lightest, smallest, most versatile components available. Therefore, I use bits and pieces from the above gear sets, and these bits and pieces can be connected together in a huge variety of ways. For example, they can be made into a long selfie stick, they can be mounted to my tripod to make it extra-tall, and they can be used with my tripod and Go Mic to position the microphone directly in front of my face while I'm recording voiceovers at a desk.

MICROPHONE ACCESSORIES I USE:
Foam Mic Cover ► http://amzn.to/2sSagRo
Pop Filter ► http://amzn.to/2sSJSHf
EXPLANATION: To improve sound quality for voiceovers, I place a mic cover on the Samson Go Mic, then use an elastic band to hang the pop filter on top. This is not the best audio protection available, but it is the most minimalistic and space-efficient gear for traveling. The mic cover can also be used on the rare occasion that I record audio with the Zoom H1.

GEAR I USE FOR CHARGING ON-THE-GO:
Anker Mini PowerBank ► http://amzn.to/2sHy8HZ
Silicone Cables ► http://amzn.to/2tgXf1i
Adapter for Micro to Mini ► http://amzn.to/2sEhlVm
Adapter for Micro to Lightning ► http://amzn.to/2sMBGbd
EXPLANATION: Anker's lipstick-sized powerbanks are small yet powerful. I travel with two, so that if one has a low charge, I can charge it in my hotel while I'm out and about with the other powerbank. Using the powerbank in conjunction with the short, durable silicone cables and micro/mini/lightning adapters means I can charge just about any device while on-the-go.

6827,Trip to Dudhsagar Falls - Best Places to visit in Goa,/watch?v=HqhBJgA9mak,travel blog,"Dudhsagar Falls is a must visit tourist attractions in Goa. It is located in the hinterlands of Goa. Dudhsagar Waterfalls cascades down about 1000 feet from the Western Ghats bordering Karnataka state. The best view of waterfalls is during monsoons. However, it is not accessible or prohibited to enter the Bhagwan Mahaveer National Park during monsoons for the safety purposes. One can get a glimpse of Dudhsagar Falls while traveling on the Vasco Hubli Indian railways train journey. Post monsoons sometimes in October each year the Goa Forest department allows the public to visit the base of Dudhsagar Falls in the organized Jeep Safari's starting at Collem, Goa. An hour-long Jeep drives through the forest on the mud road takes visitors to the base of the waterfall. One can swim in the green pool formed at the base of waterfalls with a life-jacket. This video was captured during our trip to Dudhsagar Falls. If you are visiting Goa, make a trip to this beauty of nature. Dudhsagar Falls is one the most beautiful waterfalls in India.

""Goa""
Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the area’s tropical spice plantations.

A tiny emerald land on the west coast of India, the 25th state of the Union states of India, was liberated from Portuguese rule in 1961. It was a part of Union Territory of Goa

Goa is also known for its beaches, party,  ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.

6878,Delhi To Manali By Road | I stayed At A Celebrity Resort In Manali | Travel Vlog,/watch?v=3Hb_gz4Q9T4,travel blog,"I recently went t o Manali – the 3rd most popular tourist destination of India and explored this hill station like a tourist. Here is a vlog about my 1st few days in Manali. I visited Mall Road and then got to stay at a villa in Barahgarh Estate, which is just half an hour drive from Manali. This villa is famous because many Bollywood films including Fanna, Jab We Met, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya, Purani Jeans etc have been shot here. This villa in Manali is famous for its Bollywood parties. Recently, Bhuvan Bam had also stayed at this villa during his shoot of the song ‘Sang Hoon Tere’.

I have documented my entire journey from ISBT, Kashmere Gata Delhi to ISBT Manali, Himachal Pradesh and also a few places I stayed at. This is just the vlog 1 from my Manali series. There are many interesting content ahead including my visit to Beas Kund, Rohtang, Hadimba Temple, Vashishtha and more. So, remember to check out my next vlogs that would also be about Manali and nearby places.

1st Hotel: Hotel Neelam Grand.
I paid Rs 3000+ tax for one day stay. Price varies depending upon the season and availability

2nd Hotel: Baragarh Villa - I Paid Rs 5500/day. Again price depends upon the season and availability.

6882,"Places to visit in Manali, Himachal pradesh | North India hill station",/watch?v=gSBx24veTgg,travel blog,"Manali is a popular hill station in HImachal pradesh in North India. Manali has so much to offer for travelers from snow peaks to temples to shopping and adventure sports.

I traveled from Delhi to Manali in mid July 2017 for 6 days. During the 6 day period, i have tried covering every tourist attraction in Manali.

This video should help you plan your itinerary for Manali- Himachal pradesh

Volvo busses from Delhi start in the evening between 5 pm and7 pm. Travel time from Delhi to Manali is between 12 to 14 hours. My bus started at 7.30 pm from Delhi- RK Ashram, we reached Manali next day at 10.30 am

I got reference of Royal travels through a friend, so i got my To & fro journey booked from them.

https://www.royalindia.travel/ - You can check with them if you are interested to travel from Delhi to Manali
Details of the day wise itinerary is given below:

Day 1: Trip to solang  valley plus vashisht temple.

Manali to solang valley is about 10 kms, it takes 20 to 25 minutes to reach there. Solang valley is popular for paragliding. There are 3 to 4 types of  flight starting from Rs 1000 to Rs 3200 depending upon the height you are flying from.

During winters, you can enjoy skiing at Solang valley.

Pilot with whom i did paragliding:  Ram chand: 9816170161

Vashishth temple: In the evening time i travelled to vashishth temple, which is about 6 kms from Manali. Rishi Vashishth is one of the 7 saptrishi as per Hindu religion.

Many people who have skin infection get cured automatically after bath in the kund at Vashishth temple.

Day 2:  Trip to Manikaran

Manali to Manikaran is about 80 kms, it takes about 3 hours to reach there. You can take a HImachal tourism bus from Manali bus stand or take a bike on rent or taxi on rent to travel to Manikaran.

This place has a popular Gurudwara plus a shiv temple and a hot water spring

Day 3: Visit to Bijli mahadev temple: There are two ways you can travel to Bijli Mahadev temple.
Through kullu: This route involves a trek of 3 kms which can take little more than 1 hour. Even if this involves trek, then also it is route that one should follow when going to Bijli Mahadev temple.
Through Jana waterfall: Distance between manali and Jana waterfall is 35 kms. From Jana waterfall to Bijli Mahadev temple is 24 kms. This  route is a complete off track. You should avoid this  route if you cannot undertake off road bike drive. One should avoid this unless you are very sure of biking skils.

Day 4: Local sightseeing:

Jogini waterfall: I thought to spending Day 4 of the journey doing local sightseeing, 1st half  of the day i travelled to Jogini waterfall, you will need to do trek of about 40 minutes from Vashishth temple for going to Jogini waterfall.

Manu temple: Photography inside the temple was not allowed, so i showed this temple from outside. This temple is dedicated to the sage Manu, who is believed to be the creator of world. This is the only temple of Sage manu. It is located in old Manali.

Hadimba temple: This  is located at a distance of about 2 kms from Mall road. It is believed that Hadimba did meditation in the cave at this place. This is a must visit place in Manali.

After the temple visit - i decided to do night stay at a camp, which was near Kalath, landmark near green tax barrier.

It costed Rs 1000 per day per day per person. Name of the coman who manages this is into the wild himalayas: http://www.intowildhimalaya.com/

Day 5: Rohtang pass:

Rohtang pass is 50 kms from Manali. It takes about 3 hours to reach there. You can travel to Rohtang on Himachal tourism bus or take a taxi from manali to Rohtang.

It costs about Rs 4000 to travel on a small taxi like Alto in off season. In season - which is summers May and june travel to Rohtang cost Rs 6000 or so.

Day 6:
Naggar palace: This is about 20 kms from Manali, old house of Royal family.

Hamta pass: This is about 20 kms from Manali. You need to take permission from SDM office for going to Hamta pass. You can go there on heavy motor bike or on SUV vehicle, turns are sharp, 43 curves out over there.

At the end of Day 6 i travelled back from Manali to Delhi in evening, bus started at 6.30 pm and i reached back Delhi at 7.30 am.

Most of the local travel in Manali was done on Motor bike, which i got on hire from Blacksheep..

You may contact them if needed: 9459903529 - Shitij. Their office is at Vashishth chowk.
http://bsmottoadventures.com/

My recommendation on places to eat:

The corner house: Mall road Manali- opposite SDM office.
Nirvana restaurant: Near Vashisht temple.

Since this video is particularly about places to visit, i didn’t made exclusive coverage of places to eat in Manali.

Should you have any query about Manali places to visit shown in this video, please feel free to ask that in comments below.

Thanks for taking out time to watch this video on places to visit in Manali.",gSBx24veTgg,2409797,India,2017

The noteworthy point though is, that the route till Manali is really bad.

6923,Manali Full Tour Vlog 2019,/watch?v=wkk2b1RYEKU,travel blog,"hello friends, here heavy snow fall in manali tour. dont miss my delhi to manali vlog and india tourism.
Best time to Visit Shimla to vitness snow fall. Enjoy snow related adventure activities in winter season in Shimla | hotels in manali | manali tour | shimla manali tour | shimla tourist places | delhi to manali distance | kesari tours | delhi to shimla tour package | kullu manali tour package

Details of Summary Table
1. Snowfall : Possibility of fresh snowfall at Manali town, Gulaba, Solang or at Rohtang Pass. This does not mean there will be a continous snowfall in marked months!
2. Snow Activities : Marked months are those in which one could possibly indulge in amateur skiing, snowboarding, snow mobile or just to throw snow balls at one another. In short, snow activities uncommon in much of tropical India.
For snowplay one has to head to Solang valley, Gulaba or to Rohtang Pass.
By June, snow begins to thaw even at Rohtang pass, making it difficult to indulge in snow activities.
3. Rohtang Pass: Border Road Organization decides as to when Rohtang Pass will be open for tourists. Marked months are ones in which it is most likely to remain open.

Finding Snow at Manali
Snowfall is not an all year phenomenon. Unfortunately, package holiday operators and hotels make false promises and set wrong expectations. To enjoy snow and to experience fresh snowfall, visit Manali in winter. Between July and September, even if you do find snow around Manali, chances are that it will be slippery, dirty, hardened and not good for children to play around.

During summers, the adventurous and young can visit tribal districts of Lahaul-Spiti. They are cut off from rest of the world for nearly six months as they are covered in snow. Manali-Leh road trip is enjoyable especially on your own bike.

Here you will see  Top 15 Hotels to stay in Manali -

1)Solang Valley Resort
2)Span Resort
3) Hotel Holiday Inn
4)Hotel Manu Allaya
5) Apple Country Resort
6) River Side country Resort
7) Hotel River Crescent
8) Hotel Banon Tree

This is part 1 of seven part series covering our 15 day escapade in Himachal Pradesh, India through Parvati Valley, Kasol, Kheerganga, Jibhi, Jhalori, Mcleodganj & Triund. The trip was curated by Tripver, check-out www.tripver.com for similar trips & experiences.

Himachal Pradesh : Himachal Pradesh is a northern Indian state in the Himalayas. It's home to scenic mountain towns and resorts such as Dalhousie. Host to the Dalai Lama, Himachal Pradesh has a strong Tibetan presence. This is reflected in its Buddhist temples and monasteries, as well as its vibrant Tibetan New Year celebrations. The region is also well known for its trekking, climbing and skiing areas.

Point Of view : This is a web series where I will try to cover different places in India and express my views about the place followed up with suggestions and recommendations and the view of the places from my camera :)

Email : business@hoppingbug.com

This is first video from my Point of view Sikkim Series. In this video, I take you through the beautiful landscapes coming on my way from Bagdogra to Gangtok.
This series is about my recent trip to Sikkim. It was a week long trip and I had covered Gangtok, Lachen, Shri Gurudongmar Lake, Lachung, Katao Valley and Yumthang Valley. I will be covering all the mentioned places in a 4 part series.

Sikkim : Sikkim is a state in northeast India, bordered by Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal. Part of the Himalayas, the area has a dramatic landscape that includes India’s highest mountain, 8,586m Kangchenjunga. Sikkim is also home to glaciers, alpine meadows and thousands of varieties of wildflowers. Steep paths lead to hilltop Buddhist monasteries such as Pemayangtse, which dates to the early 1700s.

Point Of view : This is a web series where I will try to cover different places in India and express my views about the place followed up with suggestions and recommendations and the view of the places from my camera :)

7024,Manali to New Delhi by Volvo,/watch?v=4xPIEIkYu4c,travel blog,"वोल्वो द्वारा मनाली से नई दिल्ली

馬里利到新德里由沃爾沃

マニラからニューデリーまで、ボルボ

وولو کی طرف سے نئی دہلی سے منالی



In this video you can understand everything about Manali to New Delhi by HPTDC AC Volvo Bus journey.

Distance between Delhi and Manali is 550 km and Delhi is well connected to Manali by roadways.
There is no airport and railway in Manali. Chandigarh is the nearest railway station to Manali that connects it with Delhi. Rest of the journey can take place by car or bus. Therefore, the best way to travel to Delhi from Manali is by Bus. Private luxury Buses and buses from Himachal Pradesh State Transport Corporation and Himachal Pradesh Transport Development Corporation(HPTDC) Volvo are available between the two cities. Ideal for families, groups, individuals and backpackers. NH 21 connects Manali with Delhi. It's an overnight journey of about 14 hours. Hospitals, dhabas, restaurants, AND ATMs are on the way.

RECOMMEND/REMARKS-
I recommend this bus service from Manali to Delhi in terms of safety, time, comfort and overall.

7028,Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib and Hot Springs in Kullu Manali - Pilgrim Tourism in India,/watch?v=XZhXZdmrzpY,travel blog,"Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib is a pilgrimage centre for Hindus and Sikhs. The famous Gurdwara Manikaran Sahib is situated in the banks of River Parvati. There is Lord Shiva Temple. The area is well known for its hot springs and its beautiful landscape.

Manikaran is located in the Parvati Valley on river Parvati, northeast of Bhuntar in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh. It is at an altitude of 1760 m and is located about 35 km from Kullu.

According to legend, when the Hindu God Shiva and his consort Parvati were walking in the valley, Parvati dropped one of her earrings. The jewel was seized by Shesha, the serpent deity. Shesha only surrendered the jewel when Shiva performed the cosmic dance, the Tandava and shot the jewel up through the water. Apparently, jewels continued to be thrown up in the waters at Manikaran until the earthquake of 1905.

This video of Gurdwara Manikaran Sahib was recorded in the 3rd week of May, 2016.

If so, let me share with you my 3rd day adventure in Manali - Rohtang trip of Himanchal Pradesh. Before I start, let me tell you I had this trip in before beginning of summer, if you go in winter these all places are covered on thick snow. So decide yourself what kind of beauty you want to explore in your trip to Manali.

Complete blog post - http://www.anilmahato.com/manali-travel-video-diary-guides-day-3-hadimba-temple-jungle-hiking/

As you already knew, we had already booked taxi for going to Rohtang. We did not took our car because the road is in very bad condition so, we prefer not to destroy our car :P . And most of the tourist does same. Major things we explored are :

1. Hiking, Skiing & Playing with Snow
Our plan for morning was to leave as early as we can for Rohtang, but due to some security reasons and weather condition Indian Army had restricted to go till Rohtang for playing snow and skiing, so we ended our plan at near Vyas kund. As you knew already in day 2 travel video, that there is very crowd good crowd of tourist about 4 - 5 thousand cars, mini trucks , taxi leaves for the trip everyday from Manali. So you must leave Manali as early as you can.Taxi Booking

There are many reasons to book taxi over taking your own car to Rohtang or Vyas Kund.

So, better try to book your taxi with Taxi Association of Manali. It's same price for everyone, so do not worry of getting ripped off in Delhi. When we visited Manali in May of 2014, the price was INR 1350 (Apx. 23 US$).

- Leave your Manali before 6 AM not get stuck on traffic jam.

Renting - Warm Clothes, Skiing Tools

Since its snow mountains its going to be very cold, so better prepare yourself with very warm clothes. We were from Delhi suffering 46 C, thought it may not be that cold, but it was very freezing. We had to rent some clothes. If you want to ski , you can also rent them all in one package. But my suggestion, its not good place to learn or ski, if you are ski enthusiast then go to Srinagar - Gulmarg, Jammu & Kashmir, one of the top 10 place to ski in the world during January to February.

On the way to Vyas kund or Rohtang, you will see so many clothers on highways. Get a good deal, there are many shops to rip you off. You will also get few old lady selling and renting for few hours at the base of snow mountain as well. We found them more cheaper compare to the shops.

Food at the fun point is going to be very expensive so better pack your food at the last village you will see on the way, you will see many people buying food. Generally you will get Indian Parantha, Biscuits etc to buy, nothing else. That's what people generally demand, so that's what they serve during morning time.

Now you are all set to blast the fun, on the way you will see beautiful road with long trees, sometime horses on sides of road grazing. Loud you taxi with music and have fun.. or just start your feeling the way want to perceive the beauty of nature in the national highway to Leh.

2. Solang Valley - Paragliding, Cable Car, Sightseeing of Mountains
This is one thing you should not miss in Manali whether you travel in summer or winter, really a beautiful place to hangout, specially in summer. This is the place where you will do paragliding, ball rolling, cable car riding etc.

There are 3 major paraglding based on distance which will cost you - INR 500(8.5$), INR 1000(17$) and INR 3500 (59$).

And then ball rolling game which will cost you 600 INR (10 $)

Another good thing of Solang Valley Manali is you can view the mountains from cable car. The basic ticket cost of cable car is INR 600 (10$) but more up you go it will cost you more.


3.  Nehru Kund
The first Prime Minister of India Pundit Jawaharalal Nehru used to drink water from this natural spring of cold clear water This spring is believed to originate from the Bhrigu lake situated high-up in the mountains. It's in national highway to Leh, you will see it while returning back to Manali.

7051,"11 Amazing Things To Do in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",/watch?v=htkZfQLK514,travel blog,"Get more things to do in Kuala Lumpur, and travel tips: http://migrationology.com/2014/02/kuala-lumpur-travel-guide-food-lovers/

I'm Mark Wiens and thank you very much for watching this video about a few of the top things to do in Kuala Lumpur, a city that just happens to be one of my favorite cities to visit in Southeast Asia. It's the largest and probably the most important and influential city in Malaysia and truly has some amazing sites to offer. Along with modern skyrise towers like the Petronas Towers, there are still lots of traditional historic buildings as well. The awesome mixture of cultures, the mix of traditional and modern, and very importantly, the outstanding cuisine is what makes Kuala Lumpur such a great city to explore!

1. On this list of top things to do in Kuala Lumpur I first stop by the most famous landmark of the the city: the Petronas Towers. These twin giant sky scrapers are huge, and they literally reach towards the heavens and touch the clouds. On the bottom of the Petronas Towers is a pretty fancy shopping mall while the tops of the towers are filled with offices. On the 41st and 42nd floor, there is a sky bridge which connects the two towers together and which is open for visitors. Years ago, it used to be free entrance but unfortunately now they have started to charge a rather steep 80 Malaysian Ringgits per person.
2. After the visiting the Petronas towers, number two on the list is the historical district of old Kuala Lumpur. Visiting and walking around the area is one of the top things to do in Kuala Lumpur and you shouldn't miss the opportunity. From Merdeka Square to the old railroad station, you'll see some amazing architecture and buildings. Another must visit is the National Mosque, which is known as Masjid Negara. With a capacity of 15,000, this is the central and most visited mosque in the city.
3. The Menara KL Tower, along with the Petronas Towers, is one of the dominating features of Kuala Lumpur's skyline. At 421 meters in height, it's one of the world's tallest communications towers. I was lucky enough to be invited to the annual BASE jumping event which was held at the KL Tower so I had a pass to go to the top for the incredible view and to see the event (http://migrationology.com/2012/10/jordan-kilgore-base-jump-kuala-lumpur/). The KL Tower also offer look out viewpoints and a number of restaurants where you can dine with an incredible view.
4. Number 4 is Little India which is better known as Brickfields. Kuala Lumpur is home to many Indian's many from the south of the country. Brickfields is a popular place to browse, shop for all sorts of Indian products and most importantly to eat at some seriously delicious Indian restaurants. If you're looking for good Indian food in Kuala Lumpur, check out this restaurant: http://migrationology.com/2012/11/south-indian-food-kuala-lumpur-vishalatchi/
5. Chinatown, located on Petaling Street, is one of the biggest Kuala Lumpur attractions. It's mostly known for it street shopping and restaurants. You can find all sorts of fake brand names and nearly everything imaginable.
6. Thean Hou Temple is one of the most impressive Daoist temples in Kuala Lumpur. It's free to visit and offers insights into the Hainanese community in the city and there are also great views of the city.
7. Central Market, is a top tourist shopping attraction in Kuala Lumpur. Though many of the products are rather touristy, there are some good things waiting to be found.
8. Within central Kuala Lumpur are the KL Lake Gardens and Bird Park. It makes a great tropical escape to the bustling city life.
9. The Batu Caves, located just outside the central part of the city is one of the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur. The caves and shrines are one of the most sacred Hindu sites outside of India.
10. Chow Kit Market is the central fresh wet market in the city. Everyday thousands of shoppers get their Malaysian food ingredients at this interesting market.
11. Malaysian food is the ultimate attraction to visiting Kuala Lumpur. With a great mixture of local Malay, Chinese, and Indian, there's no shortage of incredible dining that will leave you satisfied and hungry for more! For myself, eating is one of the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur!

Hope you enjoyed this list and hope you have a wonderful visit!

7065,What is Spin? | Quantum Mechanics,/watch?v=cd2Ua9dKEl8,travel blog,"Follow up video: https://youtu.be/z_6B2M12H9w

Research assignment: Teach me about spin.

Below there are suggested questions, recommended sources and my social media accounts:

QUESTIONS:
Questions that require less research:
1. This is our first real example of quantization, the phenomena that gives quantum mechanics it’s name. Here’s what it means. In the classical case of magnets going through a Stern Gerlach machine, the magnets can end up any where in the range. But in quantum mechanics, its can only be exactly up or down, these discrete values rather than a continuous range in between. This sort of quantization really bothered physicists. Can you understand why? And is there any classical physics phenomenon that also has sort of quantization?

2. Do you think that eventually all quantities in physics can be explained in terms of deeper physics? Are there any examples of quantities that later on did get explained through a more encompassing theory?

3. How can you use the Stern-Gerlach machine to measure spin in the ‘forward-backward’ direction?

4. Why do half the particles go left, half right at 4:24?



Questions that (probably) require research:

5. What are bosons and fermions? What’s spin got to do with it? If you really want to get into it, read ch 4, volume 3 of The Feynman Lectures: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...

6. Electrons are so-called spin 1/2 particles. Are there any other spin types? What determines what spin a particle will have?

7. How does spin relate to the Pauli exclusion principle?

8. Explain how the Stern-Gerlach machine works

9. Is light polarization a type of spin? What are arguments for and against this? What spin does a photon have (spin 1/2, spin 1 etc)?

10. Why is it that charged particles moving causes magnetic fields- according to Einstein? (Look up relativity and electromagnetism)

11. What’s wrong with saying the electron is infinitely small? What experiments measure the electrons size? Are protons also infinitely small?

12. Find other reasons we don’t believe electrons are actually spinning. (An interesting one is about rotating a spin particle 360 degrees, and not getting back the exact same wavefunction.)

13. a) What is the Bloch Sphere, and why can we use it to represent spin? How do you visualise the spin left state on it? how about spin forward? (http://comp.uark.edu/~jgeabana/blocha... , note that a 2-level system is any particle that only has two options when measured (eg only up or down). |0) and |1) are the generic labels we’ll put on these options)
b) Also, How do you write spin forward in terms of up and down (i.e. |forward)=a|up)+b|down))? You will probably need to look this up, so it’s useful to know the spin “up/down”ness is usually called spin in the z direction, spin “left/right”ness is spin in the x direction, and spin “forward/backward” is spin in the y direction. You can figure this out by looking at the Bloch sphere.

14. Magnetic Resonance Imaginging (MRI) is an important clinical technic that completely relies on manipulating spin. Explain it! http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/M...

15. What happens to the electrons if you put them into the Stern-Gerlach machine and then slowly rotated from up and down to side and side, do some of the electrons switch places? (Thank you Majoofi)

16. Why aren't there magnetic monopoles? (Thanks Culwin)

17. What is isospin? Why is it that, even though it hasn't got the units of angular momentum, it still 'formally acts like spin?' according to Wiki? (Thanks Hythloday71)

RECOMMENDED SOURCES ON SPIN
The Feynman lectures, Volume 3: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...

Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particle Physics- Eisberg and Resnick, the chapters of angular momentum and spin. This is a good one if you already know basic classical electromagnetism. Don't buy it, just visit your local university library and just read it there.

Sneaking a Look at God's Cards - Ghirardi. This is one of my favourite quantum books. It talks about the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

Wikipedia or Scholarpedia. These are always a good place to start- though sometimes they can throw you into the maths. Don't panic if you don't get all of it. Just try to glean the main idea, and that's more than enough to report here. Hopefully then others can help with any details that were confusing.

The Story of Spin.  Thank you Michael Sommers for the recommendation. I haven't read it, but it seems good! Hard to find though.

7068,The most beautiful idea in physics - Noether's Theorem,/watch?v=CxlHLqJ9I0A,travel blog,"Homework:
-What do you think of this idea? Have you heard of it before?
-Maybe you’ve heard about things like super symmetry in physics- try find out how that’s related.
-If you know some calculus and classical physics, try and find a proof of this theorem.

-Try come up with strange systems with strange symmetries- then see if you can figure out what’s conserved.


The proof and maths of Noether's theorem:
There are two ways to approach Noether's theorem that I know of. The most common is through Lagrangian mechanics- where the proof is surprisingly simple but unfortunately quite opaque (see http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/noether...) . The other way, and the way I allude to in this video, is using hamiltonian mechanics. I find this way a bit easier to understand and it involves the generators of the transforms more. A great resource for this is the last lecture in this course: http://www.physics.usu.edu/torre/6010...
but it requires multivariable calculus and a little knowledge of Hamiltonian mechanics.",CxlHLqJ9I0A,248332,,2015
7069,Understanding Quantum Mechanics,/watch?v=8Dso6Fv1FUw,travel blog,"This video is an simple introduction to quantum mechanics that explains why there is still so much controversy over the meaning of this scientific theory.

Thanks to Vlogbrothers for their sponsorship of this video! I really really appreciate it!

If you'd like to help transcribe this video into another language, that would be amazing: http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_vide...

Homework questions:

1. We talked about doing the double slit experiment with small things like electrons. But is there any reason in theory we can't do it with bigger things? If not, what would you need to do to make it work?

2.We didn't measure where the electron went in the middle of the experiment. But it is possible. If we measured each door to see if the electron went through it, what would we find? And what would happen to the pattern on the back wall?

3. There is another way to interpret the double slit experiment, which I think is really cool- it's called Pilot wave theory. I made a video about it. In that theory, the particle does go through just one door, even though our argument said that's not possible. Find the flaw in our argument. Also comment on why particles still act strange in Pilot wave theory.

Her research interests are in the areas of large-scale machine learning, non-convex optimization and high-dimensional statistics. In particular, she has been spearheading the development and analysis of tensor algorithms. She is the recipient of several awards such as the Alfred. P.

Abstract Summary:

Large-scale Machine Learning: Deep, Distributed and Multi-Dimensional:
Modern machine learning involves deep neural network architectures which yields state-of-art performance on multiple domains such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition. As the data and models scale, it becomes necessary to have multiple processing units for both training and inference. Apache MXNet is an open-source framework developed for distributed deep learning. I will describe the underlying lightweight hierarchical parameter server architecture that results in high efficiency in distributed settings.
Pushing the current boundaries of deep learning requires using multiple dimensions and modalities. These can be encoded into tensors, which are natural extensions of matrices. We present new deep learning architectures that preserve the multi-dimensional information in data end-to-end. We show that tensor contractions and regression layers are an effective replacement for fully connected layers in deep learning architectures. They result in significant space savings with negligible performance degradation. These functionalities are available in the Tensorly package with MXNet backend interface for large-scale efficient learning.

Abstract summary

Towards Scaling Video Understanding:
The quantity of video data is vast, yet our capabilities for visual recognition and understanding in videos lags significantly behind that for images. In this talk, I will first discuss some of the challenges of scale in labeling, modeling, and inference behind this gap. I will then present some of our recent work towards addressing these challenges, in particular using reinforcement learning-based formulations to tackle efficient inference in videos and learning classifiers from noisy web search results. Finally, I will conclude with discussion on future promising directions towards scaling video understanding.",h8GgxKCblfI,2790,,2017

Using Bayesian Optimization to Tune Machine Learning Models: In this talk we briefly introduce Bayesian Global Optimization as an efficient way to optimize machine learning model parameters, especially when evaluating different parameters is time-consuming or expensive. We will motivate the problem and give example applications.

We will also talk about our development of a robust benchmark suite for our algorithms including test selection, metric design, infrastructure architecture, visualization, and comparison to other standard and open source methods. We will discuss how this evaluation framework empowers our research engineers to confidently and quickly make changes to our core optimization engine.

We will end with an in-depth example of using these methods to tune the features and hyperparameters of a real world problem and give several real world applications.",J6UcAdH54RE,5967,,2016

7075,MALAYSIA’S MOST UNIQUE CITY - Genting Highlands Malaysia,/watch?v=12B1H1rFJgI,travel blog,"We day-tripped to Malaysia’s most unique city in the mountains: Genting Highlands Malaysia. With incredible mountain views and cooler temperatures, Genting Highlands was the perfect day trip from Kuala Lumpur. We took the Genting Highlands Cable Car to both Chin Swee Temple and Resorts World Genting. This is a must watch Malaysia vlog!

Our first stop was Chin Swee Temple where we were able to explore some Malaysia Chinese culture. The Chin Swee Chinese Temple in Malaysia was newly built, just over 30 years ago, but it hosts two impressively large stone Buddha sculptures. The Chin Swee Temple was an unexpected treat during our day trip from Kuala Lumpur to Genting, and we took full advantage by flying the drone for some amazing mountain views.

Next stop was to get back on the Genting Highlands cable car and head even higher to Malaysia’s most unique “city”: Resort World Genting. It’s one of the most popular places in Malaysia for gambling and casinos, but it offers so much more. Basically, this is a man made Malaysia City built into the side of a mountain where the only access is by cable car. Resorts World Genting hosts some impressive malls in Malaysia as well as hotels, casinos, and a theme park. We didn’t spend too much time in the malls, but we went to explore the mountainside to discover a truly unique part of Malaysia.

Genting Highlands is located in Pahang Malaysia and is a one hour drive north of Kuala Lumpur. This was one of our favorite things to do in Malaysia so far, as we were able to see mountains, culture, and feel cooler temperatures! If you have any questions about Genting Highland Malaysia, leave a comment below and we will answer you shortly! Thanks for watching another Malaysia Vlog… we have plenty more to come.

7091,Top Things to do in Langkawi | Traveloka Travel Guide (2018),/watch?v=kncdgjeGx6E,travel blog,"Discover the the top things to do in Langkawi with Aina and Rhys!
**TRAVELOKA TRAVEL GUIDE CONTEST ** - LANGKAWI MALAYSIA

Traveloka is giving away hotel vouchers worth RM50 each to 10 lucky winners who reside in Malaysia! Participating is super easy. Just comment, like and subscribe to our channel and you’ll stand a chance to win one of the vouchers!

Langkawi Travel Guide Overview: (0:18-0:25)

1. Jet Ski Island Hopping (0:41-2:09)

Ride your own jet ski as you zip across the blue Langkawi island ocean waves, exploring Langkawi’s many tiny islands. The 3-hour package costs RM698 per jet ski.

Be sure to stop by Dayang Bunting (Pregnant Maiden) Island, which has a picturesque freshwater lake. According to local folklore, couples having difficulty in conceiving a child should take a dip in the lake’s blessed waters.

Many of the remote Langkawi islands are uninhabited, so you’ll probably come across a secret Langkawi beach or two that you’ll have all to yourself.

2. Parasailing (2:10-3:33)

Cenang Beach is probably Langkawi’s most popular beach, where you can find all sorts of water sports and activities available. A favorite among visitors is parasailing, where you can soar through the sky and take in the view of Pulau Langkawi from up above. It costs around RM300 per person.

3. Paradise 101 (3:34-5:19)

One of the more popular Langkawi attractions is Paradise 101, a private man-made island located off Telaga Harbour Marina that’s home to a fun, floating obstacle course.

For super-fast thrills, jump on the Jet Pilot or the banana boat, which will take you careening across the water. Or even the Zip Line, where you’ll scream as you fly through the air.

Paradise Day Pass
Adult: RM240
Child: RM120

4. SkyCab & SkyBridge (5:20-7:09)

Visit two of Langkawi’s most iconic attractions, the SkyCab (similar to a Langkawi cable car) and  Langkawi Sky Bridge, for breathtaking 360-degree views you won’t forget. Get on the SkyCab at the base of Machinchang Mountain, which will slowly take you up the mountain so you can appreciate the sights.

The Langkawi Sky Bridge is said to be the longest free span and curved suspension bridge in the world, with its highest point at 708 meters above sea level.

SkyCab
MyKad Holders: RM40 (Adult); RM30 (Child)
Non-MyKad Holders: RM55 (Adult); RM40 (Child)

SkyBridge
Adult: RM5
Child: RM3

5. Langkawi Wildlife Park (7:10-8:32)

Wondering what to do in Langkawi? Check out the Langkawi Wildlife Park, where you can get up-close with over 150 species of animals from around the world. If you’re brave enough to face hungry creatures, buy food packs so you can feed them by hand.

Non-MyKad Holders: RM39 (Adult); RM22 (Child/Senior)

6. Langkawi Adventure & Xtreme Park (8:33-10:09)

To make your Langkawi trip worth it, visit this outdoor adventure park built for true thrillseekers. Here, you can try to keep your precarious balance on a skybike – a bicycle on a wire suspended 50 meters off the ground or roar through the jungle on an ATV on the 90-minute ATV adventure track

7. Kilim Karst Geoforest Park (10:10-11:17)

On the northern part of the Langkawi island is the Kilim Karst Geoforest Park, a nature reserve featuring mangroves, caves and limestone formations. Cruise down the river to view the mangrove trees that line the river. Then, visit the bat cave for a close-up view of the nocturnal residents.

Then, head to the eagle feeding spot to watch the majestic birds of prey as they swoop down to the water to scoop up their food.

Fee
RM200-500 per boat, depending on the length of the tour

8. Bella Vista Waterfront Hotel & Resort Langkawi

Conveniently located along waterfront in the town of Kuah, Langkawi, the hotel offers guests easy access to all the top activities and attractions in Pulau Langkawi.

Bella Vista has rooms suitable for every budget, from the chic-yet-affordable Deluxe Room at RM234 per night to the Loft Room for RM336 per night, a suite that comes with a charming daybed by the window – the perfect spot for a bit of reading! If you’re looking to ‘go big or go home’, book a stay at the impressive Garden Suite – for RM648 a night where you’ll have access to either a private patio in the hotel’s gardens, or a private balcony and breathtaking views of the Andaman sea.

I was hesitant to even edit this because I couldn't take proper shots (the weather was TOO COLD) and also my camera is crazy(it refuses to focus and off on its own).

Also, if you are my friends, you would know that I never listen to kpop in my entire life but because of this vlog, my spotify is full of it!

You realise that we keep coming back to the same place (eg: Myeongdong) because my friends and I were on a budget. We only managed to go to places which are near our hotel.

We indicate Chinatown as being a great budget option for accommodations in Kuala Lumpur and break down our daily budget which is roughly 150 ringgit per day for the two of us combined while offering some budget travel tips, such as eating street food (Cendol and others).

Not heading to some of the stellar beaches on offer was one of our greatest regrets.  With just a short time left in Malaysia we're hanging out and getting work done on our sites before we fly to Phnom Penh, Cambodia to being a new chapter in our backpacking adventures.

Many first travelers to Malaysia land in the capital KL.  Where would you recommend they stay for budget options in the city?  I think most of the budget options are in Chinatown, so I would suggest finding a hostel in that area.  We've been paying about 40 Ringgit, which is just over $10 USD for two people and we've been getting a pretty decent space with wifi.  That is my tip - go to Chinatown.

Your favorite way to travel?  That is again a very easy one.  Taking the train was by far my preferred method of transportation while in Malaysia.  The only actual train journey we took was from KL to Butterworth up in the north but it was just a lovely gorgeous journey.  We were passing through all kinds of diverse scenery and the seats were comfortable.  The train wasn't crowded and it was almost a bit like a family atmosphere. We had little kids running up and playing with us. It was just an awesome journey and we saw scenery we wouldn't have otherwise seen had we of taken the bus.

So for those looking to save a bit of money with their food while in Malaysia what do you recommend?  I would recommend eating lots of street food. One of our favorite dishes of mine - that I've tried - is called Cendol.  It is basically a really refreshing dessert.  You get a bowl of shaved ice and they pour coconut milk and palm sugar over top and it also has kidney beans, rice but it was very refreshing.  How much was that?  I think it was less than 3 Ringgit wasn't it?  In other words, less than $1 USD for a refreshing treat.  You can find that in restaurants and you can also find that just right out on the street with people making it with special kinds of ice machines - shaved ice machines.  Exactly!

So we've been traveling here for a month.  What would you say is a good monthly budget to have?  Well, Malaysia is one of the more expensive SE Asian countries; however, the budget we had set for ourselves we haven't been spending on a daily basis.  We had given ourselves a budget of a hundred and fifty Ringgit per day, which is roughly $50 USD and we haven't come close to spending that.  Basically, how we were going to divide that is 50 Ringgit for accommodation, 50 for food expenses and 50 for activities.  What we've been finding is that we haven't been spending it so much on the activities.  We've been doing a lot of free things around where ever we've been visiting.  I would say our roughly daily expenditure is maybe more like 110 or 120 Ringgit.  What this has allowed us to get typically is our own private room with air conditioning most of the time, a fan and typically a shared bathroom.  It is not posh accommodations by any stretch but comfortable enough.  Everywhere we've gone we've had wifi - some has been excellent and some has been not so good.  For food typically we've been having (eating) local style restaurants.  Restaurants that are frequented mostly by locals and we've been eating a lot of street food.  We've been eating really well since we've been coming here.

Whilst making photography videos on Joe's channel, this video is a behind the scenes round up of the week.

We were able to catch up with friends and their family who helped introduce us to all the hidden local spots around Penang and point us in the right direction for the best photography.

7101,Amazing MALAYSIAN street food at KUALA LUMPUR NIGHT MARKET | Food and Travel Channel | Malaysia,/watch?v=cze_4UkC5hQ,travel blog,"Subscribe for more food and travel videos: https://goo.gl/9rfeRS
We visit TTDI Pasar Malam or TTDI Night Market in Kuala Lumpur. The night market is packed with delicious street food stalls, fresh produce vendors and stalls selling everything from clothes to jewellery to electronics.

There is so much choice when it comes to the food! Unlike some of the other pasar malam we have visited in KL this pasar malam has more traditional food to try. We sample:

- curry puffs;
- air mata kucing;
- milo ais
- pulut udang;
- chicken noodle soup or bihun sup ayam;
- apam balik; and
- putu piring.

We love the vibrancy and variety of food at TTDI Pasar Malam. It is definitely worth a visit when you're in KL!

TTDI Pasar Malam
Jalan Tun Mohd Fuad 2, Taman Tun Dr Ismail, 60000 Kuala Lumpur
Sunday only
From around 4:00pm to around 9:00pm

We are in Malaysia until the end of 2017 and would love any food recommendations. Please let us know your favourite places to eat in the comments below. And if you like this video, please give it a thumbs up, share it and subscribe to our channel. Thanks so much for your support.

7116,Langkawi | Sunset Dinner Cruise with Naam Adventures | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=aei2-8UEW4M,travel blog,"It's a pretty safe bet that I'm going to be signing up for anything that includes wine, a dinner cruise, and an absolutely memorable, picture-perfect sunset.  When I landed on Langkawi and started asking around at the Meritus Pelangi Beach for recommendations on the best cruise operator, the team there shared that they favour Naam and recommended their 3-hour evening dinner cruise on the Sea Falcon so I signed up to go a few days later.  Since I was just one person and staying at the jungle hotel Ambong Ambong (and not one of the main luxury properties they have scheduled pickups at), they provided very swish transfer service in a shiny black sedan that felt wonderfully VIP following days of vans and taxis.

Ohhhh and it turns out I was the only non-Chinese guest aboard that night and I had a hoot and a half!  The wine was flowing, the food was actually really yummy, and the ambiance on the Sea Falcon was perfect.  A bit of a party at the beginning, and then we went into a chill-out vibe closer to sunset.

NOTE: for the first time in over a year, I accidentally deleted the video footage I shot on my Nikon while transferring files.  So, what you'll see is still fun but it's sadly an 'Angela show' because it's what I shot from my iPhone.  I'm so sad, as I shot some amazing footage that night.  Anyway, do check it out, it's just missing the long shots and food and boat interior images.

For more information, links to Naam, and some fun pics visit my travel blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/langkawi-luxury-dinner-cruise-is-3-hours-of-sunset-fun-with-naam

7118,Langkawi | Casa Del Mar 5 Star Beach Hotel | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=FXVZnPYLX8k,travel blog,"From the moment I caught sight of the charming architecture, the bold colours contrasting the blue sky, and my personal garden, I couldn't tell if I was Italy or Spain but somehow I was instantly transported back to the Med.  Then I turned around and my heart knew I was on the UNESCO World Geopark site of Langkawi, at the lovely Casa Del Mar.  This quaint five star hotel is home to just 34 rooms, making our stay an intimate affair where the staff remembers our usual order, knows our likes and dislikes, and instantly acts like we're part of the family.  In fact, this luxury property exudes such a chilled and relaxed vibe that I didn't fuss over how I looked once and simply relaxed throughout my entire stay.

Set on the pristine Pantai Cenang beach, Casa Del Mar Langkawi is just a quick 10 minute drive from the airport and with lots of shopping and dining all around.  The cosy feeling of check-in on overstuffed sofas begins the chilled experience you'll feel throughout your stay.

They have fun surprises like shelves upon shelves of books organised by language and a huge DVD library that you can simply walk up to and select what you'd like, which I did a couple of times and loved.

I’ve always loved curry and I’ve always loved fish heads, so fish head curry would naturally be one of my favorite foods to eat - there’s nothing not to like about digging out little bits of fish from all the crevices, while sucking up all the curry sauces.

We checking out three different fish head restaurants in Kuala Lumpur, each serving a totally different style of fish head.

Annuar's Fish Head Curry: https://goo.gl/maps/tBQjm3HkNXP2
One of the most legendary Malaysian street food stalls in Kuala Lumpur is Annuar's Fish Head Curry, also known as the Bangsar fish head corner. Mr. Annuar is an amazing hard working man who has been selling his south Indian Muslim style fish head curry for a long time and has a loyal following. He’s also known for his affordable prices and his fried chicken. The staff were all incredible nice, and their fish head was amazing. I also especially loved the fried chicken with the fish head curry sauce on top. Mr. Annuar would not charge us for our meal, thank you!

Tugu View Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/uvSfgwf3qss
Next we went to Tugu View Cafe, an amazing local Malay food restaurant on top of a hill in the middle of Kuala Lumpur, although it felt like you were in the middle of a mountain park. They serve all sorts of Malaysian food, but their most famous dish is their Malay style fish head curry. We met the chef of the curry, and I just asked him to choose us the largest size which happened to be a 120 RM fish head! Most of the others were 45 - 65 RM! This was probably the best fish head curry for me of this entire Malaysian food fish head curry tour. The complexity of flavor and the ingredients blew me away.
Total price - 144 RM ($35)

Restoran Mun Kee Steam Fish Head: https://goo.gl/maps/X5dbhmdBTKK2
Finally to end this fish head curry tour, we went to a Chinese restaurant. So this wasn’t actually a fish head curry, but a steamed Chinese style fish head. They gave us not only the head, but really the entire body minus the tail. It was delicious, perfectly steamed with wonderfully fragrant ginger, and it was a perfect fish to end the meal with.
Total price - 98 RM ($23.80)


This was an amazing fish head curry Malaysian food tour in Kuala Lumpur!

They've re-created the traditional roast perfectly and added in a few surprises and I can't wait to go back for more.

Honestly, it was a wonderful change to enjoy a brunch that has a strong personal identity.  No waffles or donuts and definitely no egg, kid or around-the-world food stations.  It's a grown-up brunch with a focus on seafood and European treats and it's fabulous.

7127,VLOG Kuala Lumpur to Cameron Highlands by Car | Expat Travel Malaysia,/watch?v=62OubzAczdM,travel blog,"I've been a mega fan of road trips from the time I was a little girl and dad would drive us from Los Angeles to the Colorado River for week-long water ski trips.  It was very fun!  Since then I've road tripped in Mexico (where I was shot at by bandits, you can read about that adventure here http://expatangela.com/personal-blog/american-attacked-in-mexico/ ), solo in the Rocky Mountains, around a dozen countries in Europe with friends, for a week in Tunisia just my daughter and I ... and now solo again for the first time in my new home of Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur to Cameron Highlands.

The trip from KL to Cameron Highlands takes about 3 1/2 hours via Tapah, which is the way it was recommended I travel by a friend who has a home in Cameron Highlands.  The route turned out to be perfect, with so much to see and experience along the way ... as you'll see in the video.

Join me for a bit of fun exploring rest stops (in hunt of killer coffee), stopping to take in the sights and rugged beauty of the Cameron Highlands landscapes, and even digging into some truly unique street food.

My favourite culinary treat from my mini solo road trip was a banana pancake.  The family that operates the stall where I ate it shared that this dish was reinvented during the Japanese occupation out of necessity.  It was impossible to procure cooking oil for some families back then so the locals were forced to cook with fire alone, thus bringing a fusion style of cooking to the area that I found to be absolutely delicious ;-)

Oh, and be sure to bookmark the fabulous rest stop between Cameron Highlands and KL.  It is the Kawasan Rehat & Rawat Ulu Bernam located South Bound on the E1 just before exit 121 https://www.google.com/maps/place/R+%26+R+Area+Ulu+Bernam+South+Bound/@3.663736,101.519387,15z/am=t/data=!4m25!1m19!4m18!1m6!1m2!1s0x31cc37da9460b18b:0xca00f79e1641a9d7!2s157+Hampshire+Place,+157+Hampshire+No+1,+Jalan+Mayang+Sari,+Hampshire+Park,+50450+Wilayah+Persekutuan,+Federal+Territory+of+Kuala+Lumpur,+Malaysia!2m2!1d101.7163902!2d3.1630041!1m6!1m2!1s0x31ca5082fa7f0d47:0x655625f6e1faf2f4!2sCameron+Highlands,+Pahang,+Malaysia!2m2!1d101.3801441!2d4.4721201!6m3!1i0!2i2!3i0!3m4!1s0x0:0x94c662b34568fa38!8m2!3d3.6637371!4d101.5193877

Come with me on day one of my amazing adventure at Gunung Mulu National Park, a highlight of all my travels in 2016.  It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with amazing experiences in the Sarawak rain forest.  I walked on a half kilometre canopy skywalk and was in the deer and lang caves, which boast over 2 MILLION bats! In fact, I saw thousands of bats, walked for hours in some of the prettiest forest I've seen in my life, and had a blast that day.

The canopy skywalk experience was a group guided tour through Mulu Park, which was very fun.  Then I booked a private VIP tour though the (OMG so fabulous!!) Mulu Marriott where I was staying with their top guide Steve Duloi and we had a blast.  Thanks to Sarawak Tourism Board for helping me to plan this trip, it was perfect!!

7132,Penang | Hotel Penaga Boutique Heritage in Georgetown | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=b3PWt5O1CQw,travel blog,"From the moment I walked through the doors and into the eclectic mix of art deco décor at Hotel Penaga, I could imagine what it must have been like back in the 1920s.  Lovely stained glass windows followed me as I walked from the bold geometric floors onto a natural footpath through flowering trees to the Transfer Suite.  This is a wonderfully restored luxury boutique property located just on the edge of the UNESCO protected world heritage site, in heart of downtown Georgetown.

Why You'll Love Hotel Penaga:
- Transfer Suites are quiet and charming, with wonderfully curated antiques inside and an open balcony perfect for sipping your morning coffee
- Cinnamon Restaurant and Bar is 100% for foodies.  I ate so well there, and enjoyed a few of the best lemongrass martinis I've ever sipped!
- The location is perfect for exploring the historic areas of Penang

Our visit Kuala Lumpur travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums, fascinating temples and the city by day and evening when Kuala Lumpur comes alive at night. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Kuala Lumpur tourism brochure, Kuala Lumpur city tour or Kuala Lumpur itinerary.

25 Things to do in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Welcome to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia! In this travel guide we’re going to take you on a whirlwind tour of a city that we have visited many times before. Our travels are often dictated by food, and KL offers a delicious smattering of Malay, Chinese, and Indian flavours that create some mouthwatering dishes that keep us coming back for more. But because you’re probably coming here for more than just food, in this video we’ll be taking you around some of the city’s main attractions, while also showing you some popular street markets as well as few of our favourite restaurants. Now let us show you 25 things to do in Kuala Lumpur:

So that’s a wrap for our time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia! We hope you enjoyed following along and that you go a few ideas of things to do, places to visit, and of course, foods to eat while you’re there.

This is part of our Travel in Malaysia video series showcasing Malaysian food, Malaysian culture and Malaysian cuisine.

7136,Langkawi | SkyBridge & Glass Bottom CableCar | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,/watch?v=xq2UYBD00us,travel blog,"Glass bottomed cable cars, panoramic views, and a terrifying glass window you can stand on hundreds of feet above ground ... well, those are just three reasons that the Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCar experience is definitely the biggest and best 'must do and see' activity on Langkawi.  Opened in February 2005, the main boarding station for the gondola-style cable cars is located at the foothills of the picturesque Machincang mountain, said to be on a part of Southeast Asia that is the most ancient and the first to have emerged from the sea.

The SkyBridge is the longest 'free span' and curved bridge in the world and it's exciting just to be standing on it!  I had a challenging but fabulous time as you'll see from the video :-)

3 Tips for the Best Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCab Experience:

1 - Ride in the glass bottomed cable car!  Although the VIP gondolas are pretty cool with music, food & drinks, and only 3 comfy seats per car, I prefer the 95 Ringgit glass bottom SkyCabs for their roomy feel and amazing views.  Don't even consider the normal SkyCab, trust me on this one.
2 - Opt for the SkyGlide!  To go from the top station to the SkyBridge in just a few seconds, riding on the SkyGlide is a breeze and only an extra 10 Ringgits.  Otherwise you have 12 minutes of stairs up and back.
3 - Take off your shoes!  As you walk along Langkawi's SkyBridge you'll notice that a few of the floor panels are made of glass, giving you a birds-eye view of the canyon below.  For some reason, the feeling of standing on that was one of the scariest things I've done in AGES!  It's truly spine chilling but absolutely worth it.  It's one of my favourite memories of the SkyBridge for some reason.

7137,"Borneo | Caves, Long Boats, Village Life - UNESCO Mulu Park | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog",/watch?v=7tO-_BO-Qqg,travel blog,"Exploring the beauty of Malaysia and it's rich cultural heritage was never more fun for me than THIS trip to Sarawak, Borneo.  And heading out on a traditional Malaysian long boat before any other tourists in Gunung Mulu National Park was the BEST choice to enhance my travel experience.  Not only was I able to shoot the Cave of the Winds and Clearwater Cave in the UNESCO World Heritage Site without anyone else around but it offered me a glimpse into real village life along the Sungai Melinau Paku river that I would have never seen otherwise.

In today’s time hungry world, people want to try and experience so much in so little time. In fact, we discovered that most people travelling around Asia would spend on average 36 to 72 hours in any given capital city. So we decided to the same thing. Overnight will go through 5 large Asian cities (Taipei, Saigon, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Seoul) and will attempt to show you what you can do during those precious few hours you have in the metropolis. From drinking, eating, discovering new cultures all the way up to clubbing. Overnight’s got you covered.

Hello, haven't seen you in a while! Thanks for 200k subs by the way, this is amazing and more than I everrrr imagined when starting the channel.

So, six days ago I came home from a 6 day trip to Seoul (7, if you count the flight, which was 15 hours in total btw omg...). It was the best trip of MY ENTIRE LIFE, and trust me I've been to some cool places before.
I went there alone, so I travelled all by myself. It wasn't scary at all though. The people there and at all airports where super nice and every time I was lost, there was free Wifi somewhere around me, so I survived without problems.
One of the highlights was definitely making a Korean friend. When I was in Myeongdong he came up to me and after we talked for a while he asked me if I wanted to have lunch with him the next day. He lives in Seoul and knows all the good places which he was kind enough to show me.
Obviously I did more than just the things in the vlog, but I didn't film the entire time I was in Seoul. I think you will understand that sometimes it's very nice to put the camera or your phone away and just enjoy the moment. :)
I can't wait to come back (hopefully next summer) since there is a lot of stuff that I didn't have time to do in Seoul. Next time I also would like to visit Busan and Jeju island.

Hope you like this,
lots of love!!

7162,Seoul Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),/watch?v=sr3O7ArQTYY,travel blog,"https://www.expedia.com/explore/south-korea/seoul.d178308

Welcome to Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Start your adventure at the K-Style Hub, a state-of-the-art visitor centre where South Korea’s past, present and future converge.
 
At the head of Gwanghwamun Square sits the statue of Sejong the Great, whose reign oversaw a golden age of literature, science and technology. The great leader sits before the grandest of Seoul’s five royal palaces, Gyeongbokgung, the Palace of Shining Happiness.
 
A short bus or subway ride to the east, are the adjoining palaces of Changdeokgung and Changgyeongung, while just to the south at Deoksugung Palace, see the changing of the guard which takes place three times each day.
Just to the west, is the last of Seoul’s great palaces, Gyeonghuigung, a royal refuge in times of unrest.
 
After exploring Seoul’s temple complexes, see how ordinary Koreans once lived at the Namsangol Hanok Village. Then explore the Korea Furniture Museum where over 2000 exquisite items of furniture are displayed within ten traditional houses. The story of Korean craftsmanship continues at the National Museum of Korea, which houses national treasures such as the Ten Story Pagoda.
 
Close to Seoul’s great South Gate is Namdaemun Market, where locals have been bargaining hard for over 600 years. Looking for some Gangnam style? Head just upriver to Samseong-dong, the Beverly Hills of Seoul.
 
Spend a few hours in the wooded surrounds of the Bongeunsa Buddhist Temple, a peaceful antidote to the fierce pace of Seoul’s shopping. Then hike to the peak of Namsan, and take in the sweeping views from Seoul’s iconic tower. When the sun gets low, join locals on the banks of the Han River to see the Banpo Bridge erupt in waves of water and light.",sr3O7ArQTYY,1414990,South Korea,2017

WHERE TO STAY IN SEOUL, KOREA
AIRBNB near Myeongdong and Insadong

On my first time in Seoul, Korea, I opted to stay at an airbnb rather than at a usual hotel. I heard some good things fro my friends regarding airbnbs so I decided to give it a try, in Seoul!

Here's what you need to know about AIRBNB

1.) Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms.

2.) You need to book online using an online payment method like credit card or paypal.

3.) This room that I booked is located in Jongno-Gu, only few minutes away from Jonggak Station. THE NAME OF THE ROOM IS COOL★CUTE 74 Myeongdong.

4.) It is a few blocks away from Insadong and couple blocks from Myeongdong. Perfect spot if you like the ""shopping"" part of Seoul.

5.) BEST part is that it is right across the Cheonggyecheon Stream!!! So, you can always go out at night and would still be able to ""tour"".

6.) THIS IS NOT SPONSORED.

7.) However, the airbnb is located right on the ""busy"" streets of Jongno. There are karaoke rooms and restaurants right below the building. It could be a PRO or a CON depending on your preference.

8.) I PAID Php 11,630.55 for my stay from November 3 to November 6.
Check in is 3PM and check out is 12 NOON. You can't check in early nor leave your luggages. That's why I showed on my previous vlog where you could rent luggage locker for your stuff.

9.) I was ALONE when I stayed. If you are staying with someone, with friends or with family members, I think the rate would almost be the same.

10.) NOT ALL airbnbs are the same. Please book at your own risk. After this stay, I transferred to a Hotel until November 10. Then, from November 10 to November 12, my BF and I stayed in another airbnb just on the SAME building but a different room and different owner. I was DISAPPOINTED. It wasn't clean, it's small and stuffy. The floor and walls look dirty. The photos look better than the actual room and the sheets look like they were not changed. See, not all airbnbs are same. So, be careful and picky when booking.

7168,Amazing Korean Food and Attractions in Seoul! (Day 2),/watch?v=QZcVXkkhVH0,travel blog,"Dongdaemun Grilled Fish Street► https://migrationology.com/dongdaemun-grilled-fish-street/
Seoul Travel Guide here► https://migrationology.com/travel-guides/seoul-korea/

Day 2 on Seoul turned out to be a great one full day tour of Seoul. We started by visiting a few of the most famous Seoul attractions, had an incredible lunch, and then continued on to visit more attractions and ended with an amazing Korean grilled fish dinner.

00:51 Deoksugung Palace; 1,000 Won ($0.84); City Hall Station, Exit 2. For our first stop for the day, we took the Metro to Deoksugung Palace, which is one of the number of famous Royal palaces in Seoul. It was a nice place to walk around, still pretty quiet in the morning when we got there.

1:54 Gyeongbokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Station, Exit 5; Entrance price - 3,000 Won ($2.53). One of the most famous attractions in Seoul is the Gyeongbokgung Palace, and it’s an absolutely huge complex where you can walk around and see the different palaces and temples. We didn't’ have a lot of time, but I did spend a few minutes watching the guards at the front, and then walking around the inner sections of the palace. It’s one of the must visit places in Seoul.

3:46 Bukchon Son Mandu Restaurant (북촌손만두); 35,000 Won for 4 bowls of noodles, 1 combination plate of mandu dumplings for 12,000 Won. Located near to Bukchon Hanok village is a legendary restaurant in Seoul known as Bukchon Son Mandu (북촌손만두). I had eaten there before on a previous trip to Seoul, but at a different location at Insadong. This time we ate at their original location, and they specializes in both mandu dumplings, and bowls of noodles. We ordered a mixed plate of mandu which included both fried and steamed mandu and I got a bowl of mul naengmyeon (랭면), which is a Korean ice cold noodles dish. All the food was delicious. Bukchon Son Mandu is a great place to eat when you’re in Seoul.

9:54 Bukchon Hanok Village; Another one of the top attractions in Seoul is the Bukchon Hanok Village, an old village in the heart of Seoul where you can find traditional buildings and homes and businesses. It has become a bit on the touristy side, but there are many locals that visit, and I think it’s a great place to take a walk and enjoy the atmosphere of Seoul. We also stopped to have a couple skewers of what is one of my favorite Korean street foods, dakkochi, which are grilled chicken skewers.

11:07 Korean Street Food near Dongdaemun Market: In the evening, we took the Metro over to Dongdaemun station and found a small side street to eat some Korean street food snacks. We had tteokbokki, gimbap, and some kind of boiled fish tofu on a stick. All the snacks together came to 7,000 Won ($5.91).

13:18 Dongdaemun Grilled Fish Street: For dinner, we didn’t really have any plans, but we just happen to stumble into what I later found out was the Dongdaemun Grilled Fish Street, because there were at least a half dozen grilled fish restaurants. The restaurant served a number of different types of fish, all salted heavily and grilled. Along with rice and all the banchan sides, it was a Korean food meal I loved.
17:34 Dongdaemun Area: Finally, to end this full one day tour of Korean food and attractions in Seoul, we took a walk around the Dongdaemun area, full of shopping malls and action.

I think it turned out to be a pretty good one day in Seoul!

TRIP TO KOREA
Travel Guide , Tips and Itinerary

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW :

*South Korea has 4 seasons : Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall
Be sure you prepare right clothes for the season.
I went to Korea in Autumn. It was cool and a bit chilly, especially for someone who comes from a tropical country.
If you're going late Autumn, prepare scarf, bonnet and gloves.

*I took Philippine Airlines and it takes about 4 hours from the Philippines to Incheon, Korea.
The airfare was around $340.
From Incheon going to Seoul, it would take about an hour travel.

*Myeongdong Tourist Information Center  
Seoul, South Korea
Address: 66 Eulji-ro, Euljiro 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea
Hours:  9AM–8PM
Phone: +82 2-778-0333
Price is 2,000 WON per locker.

*I stayed at an AIRBNB in Jongno-gu, near Insadong
I will be uploading an AIRBNB room tour + tips so
please check out my other Korea vlogs.

*Things you need to prepare are KOREAN WON and LOCAL SIM
so you could go around and get to places. I changed some money in the Philippines and the rest, I exchanged in Myeongdong
for 20 WON for 1 PESO. So, its about Php 5,000 for 100,000 WON.

I know I'm super late and like stated in the beginning of this video I wasn't even gonna post it.. I've said this before that I'm shy and just not confident enough to vlog myself in public so I randomly started filming without even really talking or explaining what's going. However I decided to share it with you (after 3 months lmao) after getting loads of supportive messages. So please bare with me.
I'm gonna be in Seoul again in September and I will try my best to post a better Vlog.
I love you guys

7215,How I Plan My Trips to Seoul 🇰🇷 🇰🇷 🇰🇷,/watch?v=qp5pPLRY03I,travel blog,"♡♡♡ ---------- ᴏᴘᴇɴ ᴍᴇ! ---------- ♡♡♡


Apologies for the late upload~ I've been pretty busy and this video took longer than expected to make! Please remember that everyone will have different experiences and preferences, and I am simply sharing what I've learned from my past travels. I hope it will, in some way, help you guys with planning your future trips, whether the destination is Seoul or not.

I know I owe you guys quite a few videos (money management, diary update, etc.) and I'll try to work on them soon! I just have a few others that I'd like to upload first (Lose Control & Hey Mama unboxings, fansite season's greetings recommendations). Please be patient with me! 😊

7227,BACKPACKING UDAIPUR @RS 4500 | RAJASTHAN| CITY OF LAKES| WITH FRIENDS,/watch?v=WEUfh5Y-jgs,travel blog,"Disclaimer - Please note the prices mentioned here are purely based on negotiation and can vary from time to time depending on the season you travel. I'll make a video on how to find an accommodation and bargain for a cheaper price soon.

This is one of my trip with my closest friend Violetta Dann and her brother Kai Dann who were in India for few days. We decided to spend the long weekend in Udaipur and this is one of my first trips where I was staying at semi luxurious places since my friends were on vacation and they wanted to relax so I didn't go for cheapest accommodation that I usually take. This trip turned out to be one of my best trips with so much of learning invloved.

I missed the sunset boat ride which is little expensive since its run by private companies. However, you can take similar boat ride for much cheaper(almost half price) by taking the government the government boat. You need to take an auto costing Rs 80 to the government boat stop which is close to Lake Pichola.

7235,Budget Travelling In Jaipur | Cheap And Clean Hostels | Backpacking In Rajasthan,/watch?v=3_R8Z-hKbtY,travel blog,"I recently went to Jaipur, the Pink City or India, the capital city of Rajasthan. This time I did backpacking in Jaipur and stayed at one of the best backpackers hostels in Jaipur called THE HOSTELLER. This trip from Delhi to Jaipur by road was super fun as I got to travel with many other travel bloggers. We started from Delhi at around 11 AM and reached Jaipur at 7-8 PM. We had a traditional Rajasthani welcome at the hostel with rajasthani folk song, dance and food. Next day, we went on exploring Jaipur in a limited time and budget. The laces I visited in just Rs 500 include Bapur Bazaar, Badi Chaupad, Johri Bazaar, Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh fort, Galtaji Temple, Birla Temple, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar etc.

I loved my budget stay at The Hosteller in Jaipur. This hostel is simply superb and provides everything that one could look for in order to travel Jaipur.

Special thanks to Mr. Rohit Gupta (Collector of Udaipur), for allowing us to contribute our skills for the smart city project. We also thank tourism department, forest department, udaipurblog and all the people who have provided us the support directly or indirectly.

We are sure that this video will help Udaipur in its smart city project and it will be useful in promoting the city as well.

Our dream is to shoot aerial videos of all the tourist places and contribute in the growth of tourism. India has rich history, monuments and some amazing events which can be documented in aerial videos.

If you have contacts in administration or government of your city or state then you can help our project by providing us the permissions to shoot at various places across India.

We are expecting support from  local authorities by giving permissions to shoot in their respective cities. Our content can help those cities to promote themselves on international level and this can contribute in the growth of tourism. In our next schedule we are planning to shoot at varanasi, haridwar, jaipur, allahabad, bhopal etc.

We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Jaisalmer tourism brochure, Jaisalmer city tour or Jaisalmer itinerary.

Jaisalmer City Guide | India Travel Video in Rajasthan Transcript:

After an 18 hour overnight train ride from Delhi, we finally reached Jaisalmer, a city of yellow sandstone that lies in the middle of the Thar Desert. This proved to be my favourite stop of our month long adventure in India; now let me take you on a tour and show you why.

With so much colour all around us, it wasn’t long before we were lured into a shop and found ourselves picking out souvenirs in the form of wall hangings, pillow cases, and a small painting or two. Our luggage gained an extra couple of pounds in this city alone.

But it wasn’t all shopping in Jaisalmer. We also made time to do a bit of sightseeing inside the fort, and one of the main attractions here are the Jain Temples.

Another thing we’d recommend doing in Jaisalmer is having dinner on a rooftop restaurant while the sun sets. There are plenty of restaurants scattered across the city and the views you get as the sun goes down are amazing. We chose one at random and it included a live music performance.

The following day was all about visiting the Thar Desert on an afternoon camel trek. It was a nice change of pace from the city, and we got to enjoy a traditional meal cooked over a campfire.

The next morning we went back to the fort because we just couldn’t stay away. I visited the Jaisalmer Fort Palace Museum & Heritage Center, while Sam and his mom picked up a few additional gifts for family back home.

This is part of our Travel in India video series showcasing Indian food, Indian culture and Indian cuisine.

7277,Places to visit in Udaipur |  udaipur tourist places,/watch?v=nlxBxzskj4E,travel blog,"Udaipur casts its spell and everyone gets mesmerized by it! It wouldn’t be incorrect if we label Udaipur as one of the most romantic places in India. Proffering a perfect mélange of culture, history and traditions, the gorgeous city makes for the perfect honeymoon destination, cultural centre and face of Rajasthan. I believe what gives Udaipur its pretty face is the brilliant architecture and the Mewars should be given the credit for it. These wise rulers literally created an oasis amid the desert, thanks to their love for leisure and passion for creation. There is so much that one can see in Udaipur and most of these attractions have been built and created by the Maharanas.

Check out this list of tourist places that we have prepared for you, so that you do not miss out on the best that Udaipur has to offer:

Udaipur India - Explored by a Native Maori!

In this India Travel Vlog, us two kiwis explore India's most Romantic City, Udaipur. We loved travelling around Udaipur, otherwise known as 'City of Lakes' 'The White City' or the ""Venice of India.' Udaipur is located in southernmost part of Rajasthan state and is set around a series of artificial lakes and is known for its lavish royal residences. As Kiwi's travelling through India, we were shocked but pleasantly surprised to find a few Indian people in Udaipur who could speak a few words of New Zealand's Native Langauge Te Reo Maori. It wasn't hard to find things to do in Udaipur,  we were blown away by the beauty of the lakes and had fun discovering local markets, parks, Rajasthani cultural dance and Rajasthani food!

Dad' first diwali in India and we spent it in Mumbai at Juhu beach. Dad tries all kinds of Indian foods and we're supposed to make a train journey from Mumbai to Jaipur.

Indian hospitality is truly unrivaled and this Indian family truly gave dad's best diwali gift by letting us on their train journey from Mumbai to Jaipur.

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before.

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9h

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?

7293,Udaipur - Rajasthan - World's Best City - Ayurvedic,/watch?v=uKCcouvaQnI,travel blog,"I may not have realized it at the time of my visit. It sure became clearer and clearer with each video blog that I produced that Udaipur was a special destination. It was therefore with some revindication that I discovered an article in Travel and Leisure Magazine that in 2009 declared Udaipur the ""World's Best City"". Thea article describes Udaipur as a ""City of Lakes"" and the ""Venice of the East"". In my dialogue about the city I certainly drew a comparison with Venice even not being aware of the article. Bottom line it is a lovely place and a great destination for a long term stay.
A word that is seen throughout India is ""Ayurvedic"". In this blog I give a simple definition of the concept.",uKCcouvaQnI,3125,India,2016
7294,"48 Hours in India: Delhi, Agra & Jaipur",/watch?v=KtxCDlR9rf0,travel blog,"48 Hours in India: Delhi, Agra & Jaipur

India is a country that would take an entire lifetime to fully explore, so when we set our sights on just 48 hours in India, we knew it would be a challenge. However, knocking out the Golden Triangle (Delhi, Jaipur, Agra) in a weekend might just be possible.

TripVerse dared us to try and accomplish the feat and we took on the challenge, always up for proving adventure travel in exotic destinations is possible, even during a weekend trip.

If you know us, you know we take any chance we can to travel, but spending 48 hours in India has been on our list for a long time, and with so many short, cheap flights to India from Dubai, it was only a matter of time before we took on the challenge. Using a three day weekend, we flew direct to Delhi and had a car and driver waiting for us.

The Golden Triangle is one of the most popular tourist routes in India, allowing travelers to visit New Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur in just a few days time as all three cities are not only very close together, but vastly different.

We knew we wanted to end the trip with Delhi, so we immediately landed and headed straight to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal, and tried to get there before sunrise to avoid the crowds.

The Taj Mahal is just one of those sights that you can't really believe you are looking at, something you see 1,000 times in pictures and movies your entire life. As we arrived early enough, the entire site was void of crowds and covered in a layer of mist and fog. It was incredible to watch this amazing building emerge from the fog into all its glory as the sun broke. Take your time, explore the area from all angles and take the time to just sit down and stare at one of the most amazing buildings ever built.

Remember: No camera tripods are allowed in, so make sure to check them at the entrance building before going in. You'll have to check your backpacks as well.

One your way out of the Taj, walking down the street towards the entrance, just passed the Oberoi Villas is a hotel called ""Taj Spice"" which you cannot miss. Without any of the expense or fuss of such a fancy hotel, you can easily get up to their amazing rooftop cafe and sit outside while enjoying the same beautiful view people pay thousands for at the Oberoi. Their food is delicious and beer cold - and cheap!

Check out our full 48 Hours in India itinerary on TripVerse for more detailed information on this and all the places we visited and recommend!

On our way out of town, we stopped at the beautiful Agra Fort, which would easily the be the most stunning site in Agra if it weren't for the Taj Mahal. It is well worth the visit and a fraction of the price of the Taj. ($1 instead of $10)

As soon as we wrapped up at the Agra Fort and the sun was setting it was on to Jaipur! We raced against the clock to make the 4-hour drive before it got to late and arrived at our hotel around 9 pm. A quick meal and we were off to sleep. We were exhausted but loving the adventure!

No 48 hours trip to India should be without a visit to Jaipur if you are anywhere close. It might just be my favorite city in India. There is just something different about being in Rajasthan, the Pink City, as it is called.

There is enough to fill 48 hours alone in Jaipur, but we really only had part of a day so we did all the exploring in the time we had and saw a ton! First, it was off to the old part of the city to visit the Jaipur Palace, one of the coolest and most detailed palaces we've ever seen. Make sure to make your way back to the hidden chamber with detailed and ornately decorated doorways honoring the four seasons. Make sure to have your camera ready, they are made for Instagram!

Heading out of Jaipur, stop and visit the Floating Palace and the Elephant Village. We weren't interested in paying to ride or wash the elephants, just wanted to see them. If you drive down the road from the Elephant place, there is an actual village where each family cares for 2-3 elephants and this is really cool to see. Huge elephants and people living in harmony is a wonderful thing.

Jumping back in the car with Prakash, we headed directly to the Amer (or Amber) Fort, which is one of the most amazing places we have ever seen that we never knew existed! TripVerse said we should make the trek all the way up the stairs to the top and thank god we did. The Amer Fort is SUCH an amazing place to explore and I am shocked we'd never heard of it before.

We could have gotten lost here for hours, so make sure you take the time to just wander through the hidden hallways and secret...

7298,"Amer Fort in Jaipur, India - Full Guided Tour",/watch?v=4RkbS6KcPzw,travel blog,"A full guided tour around the Amer Fort in Jaipur India.

Amer Palace (Hindi: आमेर क़िला, also spelled and pronounced as Amber) is located in Amer (a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi), 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, Rajasthan state, India. It is the principal tourist attractions in the Jaipur area, located high on a hill. Amer Fort was built by Raja Man Singh I. Amer Fort is known for its artistic style of Hindu elements. With its large ramparts, series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks the Maota Lake, at its forefront.

The aesthetic ambiance of the palace is seen within its walls on a four level layout plan (each with a courtyard) in a well turned out opulent palace complex built with red sandstone and marble consisting of the Diwan-e-Aam or the ""Hall of Public Audience"", the Diwan-e-Khas or the ""Hall of Private Audience"", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace) or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over the water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace. The palace was lived in by the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is also a temple dedicated to Sila Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya cult which was given to Raja Man Singh when he had defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh).

This palace along with Jaigarh Fort, located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the same Aravalli range of hills, is considered as one complex, as the two are well connected by a subterranean passage. This passage was meant as an escape route in times of war for the royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more redoubtable Jaigarh Fort.[

Annual tourist visitation to the Amer Palace in Amer town was reported by the Superintendent of Department of Archaeology and Museums to the Amer Palace as 5000 visitors a day, and 1.4 million visitors were reported during 2007

The Amber Fort is a very impressive structure from the exterior, set high on a hill with a big wall around it that looks like a smaller version of the Great Wall of China.

To reach the fort you walk up a steep incline that zigzags the hillside. A number of tourists hire elephants to take them up but they look mistreated and I totally disagree with this practice.

As usual the hawkers are everywhere trying to sell cameras, batteries, postcards and crappy puppets.

Once inside, the fort is very impressive with large open courtyards and even an area with convex glass on the ceiling to reflect heat in winter.

But, to be honest it is much the same as the other forts we have been too, this is not a bad thing as to me they are some of the highlights of the trip.

We tried trains, buses and even private buses before we finally found a travel agent who hooked us up with a sleeper bus with AC. There were buses on the hour which went to Jaipur, but all were very uncomfortable and non-AC. Not something that is your first choice for a 5 hour journey!

Presenting to you all - Auli -The winter wonderland of Uttarakhand.
Situated at a height of 3049m, this place is no less than a winter dream.
In this long weekend, I travelled to Auli with my friends. We were a group of 6.

Ours was a spontaneous plan and we travelled to Auli in an Ola Outstation which was the best cheapest option that we explored and moreover we were lucky to have the coolest cab driver.
We travelled in the entire night and reached Auli in the morning.

This place is best if you want to have a real experience of snow that is stretched in the entire visible land.


You can do camping and bonfire, skiing, snow hiking, fulfill your snow fantasies and experience the cable car rides.
Auli is Surrounded by mountains on all sides.

We did camping and in the morning, went to see the artificial lake that is made in the Auli Ski Point.
We did a hike of around 1.5 kms to reach there and the 360 degrees view from atop is worth watching.


So, make your plans to Auli while it’s still winter and experience the chill of snow.
Get the real winter vibes in the Himalayas.

Hope you guys like the video.

Thank you for transporting me from Udaipur to Jodhpur, housing, feeding and showing me around your home.

And Jaipur, the Pink city. With it's beautiful palace and vibrant bazaars selling scented oils and ""pashmina/silk"" scarves (aka polyester).

At some point I stopped filming as much on my trip, due to lack of footage Jaipur, the Pink City, is accompanying Jodhpur in this video. The footage isn't in chronological order, I explain why on my blog.
In no way is Jaipur lesser than Jodhpur, the attention to detail in the architecture is phenomenal and a must see.

7319,Jodhpur City Guide | India Travel Video in Rajasthan,/watch?v=vlTHEhrg6qM,travel blog,"Join us as we visit Jodhpur in this city travel guide covering the best things to do in the 'Blue City' of Rajasthan, India. Our travel video in Rajasthan (राजस्थान ਰਾਜਸਥਾਨ) covering the 'sun city' focusses on visiting Mehrangarh Fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) for some incredible views of the city and heading over to the Sardar Market (सरदार बाजार) nearby the Ghanta Ghar clock tower of Rajasthan where you can find great places to shop and grab Rajasthani cuisine (राजस्थानी खाना) and a saffron lassi. We especially recommend Jhankar restaurant where we had the best Rajasthani Thali (थाली) and regular Thali during our entire India travels. Jodhpur (जोधपुर) is also worth exploring on foot or tuk-tuk where you can just get lost down the myriad of colorful alleys. For dinner we suggest rooftop views at a restaurant where you can clearly see Mehrangarh Fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) lit up at night. It is just as spectacular by night as it is by day.

Things to do in Jodhpur Travel Guide:

1) Mehrangarh Fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) for incredible views of Jodphur
2) Mehrangarh Fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) for souvenir shopping, lunch and visiting museums
3) Autorickshaw ride around Jodhpur to really experience 'The Blue City'
4) Rajasthani cuisine (राजस्थानी खाना) ordering Rajasthani Thali (थाली) and saffron lassi (लस्सी)
5) Visit Ghanta Ghar clock tower of Rajasthan and Sardar Market (सरदार बाजार) for shopping, people watching and great food
Rajasthan (राजस्थान ਰਾਜਸਥਾਨ)
6) JHANKAR Choti Haveli Restaurant for our favorite Indian food in Jodhpur
7) Rooftop dining for views of Mehrangarh Fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) at night

Jodhpur City Guide | India Travel Series in Rajasthan Video Transcript:

Our first stop in Jodhpur was Mehrangarh Fort, which is one of the biggest forts in India. The fort sits on a rocky hill overlooking the city and it pretty much dominates the skyline with its imposing walls. Admission to the fort itself is free, but if you’ve come all the way here, you’ll want to pay the admission to visit the palaces which now act as a museum.

Within the fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) you can also visit the ramparts, see the old cannons, and get some overhead views of the city which will quickly help you realize why Jodhpur (जोधपुर) is nicknamed the Blue City.

Then, after all that food and drink, it was finally time to get lost in the blue maze that is Jodhpur.

So right now we have ended up at the Sardar Market (सरदार बाजार) just around the clock tower (Ghanta Ghar). And I would say this is both a local market and a tourist market. You can get produce and like everyday things. Yeah, you see a lot of everyday like market stalls but you also see some more ones that are geared for tourists such as the ones where you can souvenirs, carpets and saris.

Jhankar in Jodhpur (जोधपुर). Oh, it was so good Actually it was one of the best meals we've had in India so far. Yeah. So we are heading back there for dinner. And it is all about Thali (थाली) tonight. We are going to get an original Thali (थाली) and a Rajasthani Thali (राजस्थानी खाना). Because we are in Rajasthan (राजस्थान ਰਾਜਸਥਾਨ) and they have a special Thali so we can't wait to try that out. Now it is off to find a little tuk-tuk. Alright, lead the way. Lead the way.

And that’s it for Jodhpur! Our two-day visit was short and sweet, but it was enough to get a taste of what the city is all about.

So that is a wrap from Jodhpur (जोधपुर). So we had a really good time in the Blue City. Um, it was only two days but I felt like we did quite a bit. Did you enjoy it? Yeah, the fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) was magnificent and the blue city was all it was supposed to be. Yes, so now we're moving on to Jaipur. We're just waiting at the train station. So we're going to catch our train. It is about a 6 hour journey. So relatively not too long but uh yeah can't wait to update you when we get there. Ciao for now.

This is part of our Travel in India video series showcasing Indian food, Indian culture and Indian cuisine.

In this video we spend a day in Jaipur city visiting the maharajas gardens and monkey temple. Then we head to Jodhpur city to our next great hotel!

In this vlog, the reality of working conditions and pay really hit me and I see why 'made in India' is becoming increasingly affordable for business'. We also visit the most fantastic monkey temple which felt like we had stepped into The Jungle Book! We have some roof top dinner. The next day we head to the Prince Albert Museum in Jaipur. After 6 hours in the car we make it to Jodhpur, I'm feeling a little low. #jaipurindia #indiatravelvlog #jodhpur #travelvlog #indiatravelguide

This video is about trying a rajasthani thali at Jaipur.

The rajasthani thali comprised of paneer masala, gatta curry, kadi pakoda, ker sangri, dal, bati, churma, raita, papad, rice,  khasta roti, missi roti, garlic chutney, mirch tripore, ghee, papad and gud.

Each and every dish in the thali was fantastic.
I specially liked the achari flavoured ker sangri and spicy gatta curry a lot.
Even the kesar flavoured churma made with besan and desi ghee was fabulous.

The thali was shared between two, it costed ₹700/-

Udaipur is also known as the City of Lakes, is a city, a Municipal Corporation and the administrative headquarters of the Udaipur district in the state of Rajasthan in western India. It is located 403 kilometres southwest of the state capital, Jaipur, 576 km southwest of Alwar, 248 km west of Kota, and 250 km northeast from Ahmedabad. Udaipur is the historic capital of the kingdom of Mewar in the former Rajputana Agency. The Sisodia clan of Rajputs ruled the Mewar and its capital was shifted from Chittorgarh to Udaipur after founding city of Udaipur by Maharana Uday Singh. The Mewar province became part of Rajasthan after India became independent

Apart from its history, culture, and scenic locations, it is also known for its Rajput-era palaces. The Lake Palace, for instance, covers an entire island in the Pichola Lake. Many of the palaces have been converted into luxury hotels. It is often called the ""Venice of the East"", and is also nicknamed the ""Lake City"". Lake Pichola, Fateh Sagar Lake, Udai Sagar and Swaroop Sagar in this city are considered some of the most beautiful lakes in the state.

This was my first Indian train experience and I really enjoyed it!

I didn't know how to find my carriage, where to put my bag, where to get dinner, what the toilets would be like and the safety of my things but I worked it all out and I really enjoyed being in the 2 Sleeper section of an Indian Train.

I nearly got a flight from Mumbai to Udaipur but I wanted to experience a local way of travelling and I'm so glad I did!

---------------------- ✈ About PsychoTraveller ✈ ----------------------

Hi, name’s Aly! Originally from Birmingham, England, I have been discovering the world for over 4 years straight. I am a psychology graduate with a love for Pho and red wine. Whether I throw myself into a novel or from 14,000ft up out of a plane, I look at adventure big and small and say “Let’s do this!”

PsychoTraveller is more than just travel, its a platform to inform and inspire people of all ages to live the life they want to live. PsychoTraveller showcases through weekly videos her life on the road, the people she meets, the food she tastes as well as the highs and lows behind living as a digital nomad.",1zUCkx8-R9g,43627,India,2018

7349,Volunteering at Animal Aid | Udaipur | India Travel Vlog,/watch?v=Kr4vdc8pzNw,travel blog,"Volunteering at an amazing animal rescue centre in Udaipur, India - Animal Aid. During our time in Udaipur we spent a full day volunteering at the incredible Animal Aid. We bonded with orphan calves, swam with handicapped dogs, and learned the countless sad stories that led to the animals' arrival at the shelter.
Animal Aid is a truly inspiring, incredible place and the dedication of the staff and volunteers is so far beyond anything we've seen, apart from at the beautiful TOLFA.

❁ Watch on for two-day-old donkeys and all of the calf kisses ❁

7354,Rajasthan Vacation Travel Video Guide,/watch?v=GcYRxj3EXaQ,travel blog,"Travel video about destination Rajasthan in India.
Rajasthan, Land Of Kings and one of the most unique and colourful provinces in northern India on the border with Pakistan. The barren desert landscape was once the home of the Rajputes that ruled over the land for more than a thousand years.Our journey begins in Agra. Situated on the border with Rajasthan this imposing metropolis of the Moguln monarchs is an ideal starting point. The palace city, the Red Fortress, was three generations in construction. A two and a half kilometre long wall with many bastions surrounds a spacious inner courtyard and numerous palace buildings. Although artistic stone masonry decorates a number of red sandstone arcades, most of the buildings are of marble. The ruling monarch and his royal household once held official events in the public audience hall, the seventy metre long, Diwan-I-Am. The city on the Jamuna River is full of life. Hustle and bustle are typical within the crowded streets of the former capital of the Mongul realm. It is like a medieval city with market stalls and tiny workshops, narrow lanes, colourful shops and traditional buildings. The Etimad-Ud-Doulah Mausoleum is a jewel of Mogul architecture. Around ten kilometres north of Agra close to Sikandra is the large tomb of Emperor Akbar who was one of the wisest Mogul monarchs. He ruled over the Indian Empire for almost half a century and was known to be extremely tolerant of religions other than his own. The sleepy desert town of Mandawa captures the unique charm of this extraordinary region like no other. Gravel roads and sandy lanes travel past old houses with romantic inner courtyards. India’s flair and diversity is very much alive here. The Land Of The Maharajas in all its splendour: Rajasthan is a living fairy-tale beneath the desert sky.

This is my first visit to Jaipur and second visit to India!
Solo traveling all the way from Indonesia to this country because I love India with all my heart :)

Buat yang pengen nyobain jalan jalan ke India sendirian, terutama yang cewek cewek, pasti pertanyaannya ; Jaipur itu kayak apa sih? Bahaya? Apa sih yang bikin orang mau kesana?
Kalo udah nonton video ini pasti banyak dapet gambaran atas pertanyaan pertanyaan itu.

Masih penasaran? Kalo gitu langsung aja dateng ke sana!
Banyak yang bilang kalau udah visit India, pasti kesannya either you love it or you hate it. Gak ada di tengah tengah.
For me India turned as one of my most favorite travel destination. I absolutely loveeee India. Can't wait to be back!

Say hi to my new friends that I met along this journey!
